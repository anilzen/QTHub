Despite the latter scheme being more resource intensive, we show that the additional complexity of driving and controlling an auxiliary qubit can be advantageous when we subject the systems to decoherence.
<p>Moving beyond controlled systems, we examine the informational dynamics of quantum sys- tems subject to the influence of their environment. Here, we investigate scenarios in which systems transition from pure quantum states to classically objective states as predicted by quantum Dar- winism. By partitioning the environment into accessible and inaccessible parts, we reveal how the interplay between these partitions determines whether classical objectivity emerges or if the system equilibrates without the redundant encoding of the state of the system into the environment.
<p>Finally, we explore the competition between two sinks for local quantum information - decoher- ence and information scrambling. Information scrambling refers to the flow of initially accessible quantum information into complex many-body correlations within the system itself. Typical mea- sures of scrambling used in closed systems can fail to differentiate between the local information spreading throughout the degrees of freedom of the systems and the spreading of information due to decoherence. We introduce a method for probing information scrambling even in the presence of open system effects, demonstrating that the environment restructures remaining information, reducing the complexity of the system’s dynamics.
<p>Collectively, these findings provide a comprehensive framework for understanding information dynamics in open quantum systems, offering new strategies for preserving quantum coherence and diagnosing the impact of an environment on the structure of quantum information.
