Thermodynamics originally described classical systems—everyday objects formed from many particles. The theory has recently extended to the quantum domain of single electrons and few atoms, which behave in ways impossible for everyday objects. For example, quantum particles correlate strongly through entanglement, which gives one particle a surprisingly large amount of information about others. Scientists are leveraging such quantum phenomena in technologies such as quantum computers. We combine mathematical and conceptual tools from quantum physics, information processing, and thermodynamics to understand how everyday phenomena —our classical world and the flow of time—emerge from microscopic quantum physics.\nFrom 2022 to 2025, the Maryland Quantum-Thermodynamics Hub addressed thermodynamic emergence from three angles: (1) How quickly does entanglement dissipate? (2) How similar is entanglement’s dissipation to time’s arrow? (3) To what extent can quantum phenomena hinder time’s arrow? In each branch of research, we found a tension, or an apparent conflict. Such conflicts fuel physics. So, from 2025 to 2028, we are resolving those tensions. Also, we are addressing another angle on thermodynamic emergence: (4) How does quantum gravity give rise to smooth space-time? We leverage abstract theory, numerical simulations, and experimental collaborations.\nPursuing this research unifies our team into a Maryland-based hub, a center for North American quantum thermodynamics. We partner with international institutions to form a global network. Our events include annual gatherings and seminars. Also, we engage the general public in the adventure of quantum thermodynamics through a quantum-steampunk creative-writing course, a quantum-steampunk creative-writing contest, contributions to mainstream media, public lectures, and blog posts. Uncovering how everyday phenomena emerge from microscopic quantum dynamics, we are illuminating fundamental physics while establishing a lodestone for North American quantum thermodynamics.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"8576ec274c98b3831668a172fa632d80","permalink":"https://qtd-hub.umd.edu/about/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/about/","section":"","summary":"Quantum thermodynamics is an emerging field that offers fundamental insights into energy, information, and their relationship.

In that time, it has demonstrated a remarkably broad applicability, ranging from providing foundational advances in the understanding of how thermodynamic principles apply at the nano-scale and in the presence of quantum coherence, to providing a guiding framework for the development of efficient quantum devices. Exquisite levels of control have allowed state-of-the-art experimental platforms to explore energetics and thermodynamics at the smallest scales which has in turn helped to drive theoretical advances. This Roadmap provides an overview of the recent developments across many of the field's sub-disciplines, assessing the key challenges and future prospects, providing a guide for its near term progress.","tags":null,"title":"Roadmap on Quantum Thermodynamics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Devjyoti Tripathy","Juzar Thingna","Sebastian Deffner"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1768521600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1757998800,"objectID":"9003c8c588cdd507ebd355dea3986354","permalink":"https://qtd-hub.umd.edu/publication/2026-tripathy-thingna-deffner/","publishdate":"2025-09-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2026-tripathy-thingna-deffner/","section":"publication","summary":"Scrambling, the delocalization of initially localized quantum information, is commonly characterized by the out-of-time ordered correlator (OTOC). Employing the OTOC-Renyi-2 entropy theorem we derive a quantum speed limit for the OTOC, which sets an lower bound for the rate with which information can be scrambled. This bound becomes particularly tractable by describing the scrambling of information in a closed quantum system as an effective decoherence process of an open system interacting with an environment. We prove that decay of the OTOC can be bounded by the strength of the system-environment coupling and two-point environmental correlation functions. We validate our analytic bound numerically using the non-integrable transverse field Ising model. Our results provide a universal and model-agnostic quantitative framework for understanding the dynamical limits of information spreading across quantum many-body physics, condensed matter, and engineered quantum platforms.","tags":null,"title":"Quantum speed limit for the OTOC from an open systems perspective","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christopher Jarzynski","Sebastian Deffner","Saar Rahav"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1765497600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1765515600,"objectID":"8948392f30dd15313f405b134345091c","permalink":"https://qtd-hub.umd.edu/publication/2025-jarzynski-deffner-rahav/","publishdate":"2026-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2025-jarzynski-deffner-rahav/","section":"publication","summary":"Classical fluctuation theorems for work have been obtained theoretically, and verified experimentally, within a nonautonomous framework in which work is performed on a system of interest, $S$, by the external manipulation of a work parameter, such as a piston's position. Here, we obtain fluctuation theorems within an autonomous framework in which $S$ exchanges energy with a reversible work source, $R$. The two subsystems, $S$ and $R$, interact with one another as they evolve under Hamiltonian or stochastic dynamics, without external intervention. In this setting, we must account for the backaction of $S$ on $R$, which is absent in the nonautonomous setting. We obtain autonomous versions of standard fluctuation theorems for work and entropy production. In each case, we argue, the autonomous fluctuation theorem reduces to its nonautonomous counterpart when $R$'s inertia becomes infinitely large.","tags":null,"title":"Fluctuation theorems for autonomous work","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Moallison F.

In many practical scenarios, where more than one parameter is unknown, the *multi-parameter* Cramér–Rao bound (CRB) applies. Since this is a matrix inequality involving the inverse of the quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM), the formalism breaks down when the QFIM is singular. In this paper, we examine the physical origins of such singularities, showing that they result from an over-parameterization on the metrological level. This is itself caused by emergent metrological symmetries, whereby the same set of measurement outcomes are obtained for different combinations of system parameters. Although the number of effective parameters is equal to the number of non-zero QFIM eigenvalues, the Cramér–Rao formalism typically does not provide information about the effective parameter encoding. Instead, we demonstrate through a series of concrete examples that Bayesian estimation can provide deep insights. In particular, the metrological symmetries appear in the Bayesian posterior distribution as lines of persistent likelihood running through the space of unknown parameters. These lines are contour lines of the effective parameters which, through suitable parameter transformations, can be estimated and follow their own effective CRBs.","tags":null,"title":"Metrological symmetries in singular quantum multi-parameter estimation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Annyun Das","Pablo Solano","Kanu Sinha"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1761782400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1761800400,"objectID":"c86b1f1f2db0bbe5f2951aafd43ecdc1","permalink":"https://qtd-hub.umd.edu/publication/2025-das-solano-sinha/","publishdate":"2025-10-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2025-das-solano-sinha/","section":"publication","summary":"We analyze the non-Markovian spontaneous emission dynamics of a two-level test atom placed in a cavity formed by two atomic arrays in a waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) setup.

The two-bath setting is particularly suited to studying quantum trajectories, which are well-defined also for the non-Markovian case.

It stipulates that, if perturbed out of equilibrium, a system responds at a rate proportional to a thermal-equilibrium property. Applications range from particle diffusion to electrical-circuit noise. To prove the FDT, one must prove that common thermal states obey a symmetry property, the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) relation. Energy eigenstates of certain quantum many-body systems were recently proved to obey the KMS relation. The proof relies on the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which explains how such systems thermalize internally. This KMS relation contains a finite-size correction that scales as the inverse system size. Non-Abelian symmetries conflict with the ETH, so a non-Abelian ETH was proposed recently. Using it, we derive a KMS relation for SU(2)-symmetric quantum many-body systems' energy eigenstates. The finite-size correction scales as usual under certain circumstances but can be polynomially larger in others, we argue. We support the ordinary-scaling result numerically, simulating a Heisenberg chain of 16-24 qubits. The numerics, limited by computational capacity, indirectly support the larger correction.

Particular interest has been given to quantum control, which aims to prepare, manipulate, and steer quantum states toward desired outcomes. Common applications of quantum control include state preparation for quantum computing algorithms, protocols to implement nanoscale machines, and feedback to guide a system’s evolution. Feedback involves collecting information from quantum measurements, then acting on the system based on measurement outcomes. The standard measurement model in quantum mechanics is the projective measurement, which destroys quantum coherence by causing the wave function to collapse to a subspace spanned by the eigenstates of the measured operator. This thesis explores the theory of weak measurement processes, a class of measurement protocols that extract information from a quantum system while (partially) preserving coherence. The weak measurement protocol has a tunable parameter that controls the information obtained per measurement cycle and the disturbance (decoherence) introduced into the quantum system. Using this nondestructive form of measurement, one can extract information during the system’s evolution and apply real-time feedback to drive the system’s evolution to specific target states. A general master equation is derived to describe continuous feedback using weak measurements with general filtering processing. Particular cases of low-pass and band-pass filters are studied in detail and applied to a harmonic oscillator cooling protocol. Results show that ground-state cooling of the quantum harmonic oscillator can be achieved. Finally, this dissertation discusses an experimental and computational project that uses ma- chine learning to estimate the temperature and the number of atoms of a cold atomic cloud. The goal is to use non-destructive measurements to infer hidden properties of the atomic ensemble without disturbing the atomic trap. Results show that reasonable accuracy can be achieved using various neural network architectures, depending on the complexity of the input data. The accu- racy and responsiveness of the trained models make them suitable for real-time estimators that can be used in closed-loop feedback.

The incompatibility of observables is one crucial difference between classical and quantum mechanics. Thermodynamic laws must apply across classical and quantum systems.

One seminal result in thermodynamics for closed quantum many-body systems is the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which explains how a quantum many-body system thermalizes internally. The ETH applies across many fields including atomic, molecular, and optical physics, condensed-matter physics, and high-energy physics.

Murthy et al. posited a non-Abelian ETH to account for systems with noncommuting conserved quantities. We calculate numerics to support the non-Abelian ETH. We model a one-dimensional (1D) next-nearest-neighbor Heisenberg chain of 18 qubits. We represent local operators with matrices relative to an energy eigenbasis.

Barandes Harvard University\nStatistical Mechanics with Stochastic Dynamics There are a number of deep questions at the foundations of statistical mechanics, including the rigorous justification of its probability distributions, the limitations of ergodicity, the origins of the thermodynamic arrow of time, and the precise intertheoretic reduction of classical thermodynamics to quantum mechanics. In this talk, I will argue that a new approach to formulating quantum theory in terms of ‘indivisible’ stochastic dynamics may provide new resources for answering these questions, as well as for related problems, like making microphysical sense of causal influences. By employing this new indivisible formulation, I will also show how to use simple thermodynamic systems to build real-world analog models of quantum systems, like qubits.\nCeren B. Dag Indiana University Bloomington\nQuantum scarring in many-body quantum systems Quantum scars, introduced within the context of single-particle billiard model in 1984, are quantum eigenstates with an enhanced probability density around an unstable periodic orbit (UPO) in a chaotic phase space. Recently, nonthermal many-body eigenstates embedded in an otherwise thermal spectrum have been identified as a many-body generalization of quantum scars. This concept, however, is not associated to a chaotic phase space, and hence the connection between the single- and many-body notions of quantum scars had remained incomplete. In this talk, I will present the first quantum many-body scars originating from UPOs of a chaotic phase space in different spin models. These states verify the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, and we thus refer to them as thermal quantum many-body scars. While they do not preclude thermalization, their spectral structure featuring approximately equispaced towers of states yields an anomalous oscillatory dynamics preceding thermalization for wavepackets initialized on a UPO. I will highlight a particular spin-1 chain which hosts both types of scars, thermal and nonthermal where the latter is associated with stable periodic orbits. Time permitting, I will also provide evidence for the ubiquity of scarred quantum eigenstates in a generic spin-1/2 chain, and how scarring makes the system more likely to be found on an orbit it was initialized on, retaining a memory of its past.\nPhysical Review Letters 132 (2), 020401 (2024).

Additionally, I will present a short description of the early QTD experiments which used this toolkit and preview the means of expanding the toolkit, presently being pursued in my lab and others. Time allowing, I will briefly compare trapped ion simulators to other simulation platforms and/or comment on trapped ion quantum computers as tools for experimental QTD.\nEduardo Martin-Martinez University of Waterloo\nTowards Quantum Field Thermodynamics: Observational Entropy and Operational Definitions of Work and Heat We will review the notions of internal energy and work distributions in quantum field theory (QFT), highlighting the limitations of extending standard thermodynamic definitions—many of them originally developed for finite-dimensional quantum systems—to the infinite-dimensional, local setting of QFT. Following this review, we will argue for a reformulation of thermodynamic concepts such as work, heat, and entropy within the algebraic framework of von Neumann algebras, which is the language that naturally encodes the operational and localization structure of QFT. This shift is essential for constructing a physically meaningful extension of quantum thermodynamics beyond finite systems, particularly in addressing the inadequacy of the von Neumann entropy to capture thermodynamic behavior in scenarios involving coarse-grained observations or limited resolution. Within this framework, we introduce a generalization of observational entropy for systems with a richer set of controllable degrees of freedom.\nIman Marvian Duke …","date":1748350800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1748350800,"objectID":"71c73358f9535bd2e7e5aae444c10361","permalink":"https://qtd-hub.umd.edu/event/symposium-2025/","publishdate":"2025-03-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/event/symposium-2025/","section":"event","summary":"Quantum-Thermodynamics Symposium at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County","tags":[],"title":"Maryland Quantum-Thermodynamics Symposium 2025 and first annual Quantum Workshop at UMBC","type":"event"},{"authors":["George Mihailescu","Steve Campbell","Karol Gietka"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1747872e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1747960380,"objectID":"65986c4a53657c4ca547f77badb4a5d3","permalink":"https://qtd-hub.umd.edu/publication/2025-mihailescu-campbell-gietka/","publishdate":"2025-05-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2025-mihailescu-campbell-gietka/","section":"publication","summary":"Critical quantum metrology relies on the extreme sensitivity of a system's eigenstates near the critical point of a quantum phase transition to Hamiltonian perturbations. This means that these eigenstates are extremely sensitive to all the parameters of the Hamiltonian. In practical settings, there always exists a degree of experimental uncertainty in the control parameters - which are approximately known quantities. Despite such uncertainties representing the most relevant source of noise in critical metrology, their impact on the attainable precision has been largely overlooked. In this work we present a general framework, interpolating between the single and multi-parameter estimation settings, allowing for the proper bookkeeping of relevant errors. We apply this framework to the paradigmatic transverse field Ising and Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick models, explicitly showing how uncertainty in control parameters impacts the sensitivity of critical sensors. For finite-size systems, we establish that there exists a trade-off between the amount of uncertainty a many-body probe can withstand while still maintaining a quantum advantage in parameter estimation.","tags":null,"title":"Uncertain Quantum Critical Metrology: From Single to Multi Parameter Sensing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sagar Silva Pratapsi","Sebastian Deffner","Stefano Gherardini"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1747267200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1749099600,"objectID":"d9e47adca1940ca8a18672f5127c6d0a","permalink":"https://qtd-hub.umd.edu/publication/2025-pratapsi-deffner-gherardini/","publishdate":"2025-05-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2025-pratapsi-deffner-gherardini/","section":"publication","summary":"What is the minimal time until a quantum system can exhibit genuine quantum features?

For example, one of the hallmarks of quantum mechanics is that observables may be incompatible, implying among other things that it is not always possible to find joint probability distributions which fully capture the joint statistics of multiple measurements. Instead, one must employ more general tools such as the Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability (KDQ) distribution, which may exhibit negative or non-real values heralding non-classicality. In this Letter, we consider the KDQ distributions describing arbitrary collections of measurements on disjoint components of some generic multipartite system. We show that the system dynamics ensures that these distributions are classical if and only if the Hamiltonian supports Quantum Darwinism. Thus, we demonstrate a fundamental relationship between these two notions of classicality and their emergence in the quantum world.","tags":null,"title":"Compatibility of Quantum Measurements and the Emergence of Classical Objectivity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Reece Robertson","Emery Doucet","Zakaria Mzaouali","Krzysztof Domino","Bartłomiej Gardas","Sebastian Deffner"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1744675200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1744693200,"objectID":"17ca36a898b959aee28d095e9a03794d","permalink":"https://qtd-hub.umd.edu/publication/2025-robertson-doucet-mzaouali-etal/","publishdate":"2025-04-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2025-robertson-doucet-mzaouali-etal/","section":"publication","summary":"Dating to 1994, Simon's period-finding algorithm is among the earliest and most fragile of quantum algorithms.

Instead, recent years have seen the Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) distribution come to the forefront as a powerful quasi-probability distribution for analysing quantum mechanics. The KD distribution allows tools from statistics and probability theory to be applied to problems in quantum-information processing. A notable difference to the Wigner function is that the KD distribution can represent a quantum state in terms of arbitrary observables. This paper reviews the KD distribution, in three parts. First, we present definitions and basic properties of the KD distribution and its generalisations. Second, we summarise the KD distribution's extensive usage in the study or development of measurement disturbance; quantum metrology; weak values; direct measurements of quantum states; quantum thermodynamics; quantum scrambling and out-of-time-ordered correlators; and the foundations of quantum mechanics, including Leggett-Garg inequalities, the consistent-histories interpretation, and contextuality. We emphasise connections between operational quantum advantages and negative or non-real KD quasi-probabilities. Third, we delve into the KD distribution's mathematical structure. We summarise the current knowledge regarding the geometry of KD-positive states (the states for which the KD distribution is a classical probability distribution), describe how to witness and quantify KD non-positivity, and outline relationships between KD non-positivity and observables' incompatibility.","tags":null,"title":"Properties and applications of the Kirkwood-Dirac distribution","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zohreh Davoudi","Christopher Jarzynski","Niklas Mueller","Greeshma Oruganti","Connor Powers","Nicole Yunger Halpern"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1734566400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1712190780,"objectID":"bb9874aa61d0045b6752aff1d3fccd1b","permalink":"https://qtd-hub.umd.edu/publication/2024-davoudi-jarzynski-mueller-oruganti-powers-halpern/","publishdate":"2024-04-03T00:33:00.091248Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2024-davoudi-jarzynski-mueller-oruganti-powers-halpern/","section":"publication","summary":"A key objective in nuclear and high-energy physics is to describe nonequilibrium dynamics of matter, e.g., in the early Universe and in particle colliders, starting from the standard model of particle physics.

Quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories holds promise for overcoming computational limitations. Because of local constraints (Gauss’s laws), lattice gauge theories have an intricate Hilbert-space structure. This structure complicates the definition of thermodynamic properties of systems coupled to reservoirs during equilibrium and nonequilibrium processes. We show how to define thermodynamic quantities such as work and heat using strong-coupling thermodynamics, a framework that has recently burgeoned within the field of quantum thermodynamics. Our definitions suit instantaneous quenches, simple nonequilibrium processes undertaken in quantum simulators. To illustrate our framework, we compute the work and heat exchanged during a quench in a lattice gauge theory coupled to matter in dimensions. The thermodynamic quantities, as functions of the quench parameter, evidence a phase transition.

A control protocol can involve feedback based on measurements performed by an external agent, or it can be a predefined protocol that does not rely on explicit measurements of the system’s state. In the context of information thermodynamics, the former setup belongs to the paradigm of non-autonomous or feedback-controlled Maxwell’s demons, and the latter to the paradigm of autonomous demons. The thesis begins with a framework for analyzing non-autonomous feedback control, when the control protocol is applied by an agent making continuous measurements on the system. A multiple-timescales perturbation theory, applicable when there exists an appropriate separation of timescales, is developed. This framework is applied to a classical two-state toy model of an information engine – a device that uses feedback control of thermal fluctuations to convert heat into work. Additionally, quantum trajectory simulations are used to study a feedback-controlled model of Maxwell’s demon in a double quantum dot system. Next, a modeling scheme for converting feedback-controlled Maxwell’s demons to au- tonomous (non-feedback) systems is developed. This scheme explicitly accounts for the thermo- dynamic costs of information processing, by incorporating an information reservoir, modeled as a sequence of bits. This modeling scheme is then applied for converting the classical analogue of the non-autonomous double quantum dot Maxwell’s demon, discussed previously, to an au- tonomous model. Using analytical, semi-analytical and stochastic simulation-based approaches, it is shown that the obtained model can act either as an information engine, or as a “Landauer eraser”, and then the phase diagrams that identify these regimes of behavior are constructed. Finally, fast-forward shortcuts to adiabaticity for classical Floquet-Hamiltonian systems is developed, and applied to a periodically driven asymmetric double well (without feedback control). Tools from dynamical systems theory are then used to characterize the system’s angle- variable dynamics.

To prevent this loss, it is crucial to develop strategies that enable the rapid and precise control of quantum systems, ensuring that desired processes are com- pleted faster than decoherence times. From a control perspective, the environment is viewed as a disruptive force; however, this ignores the rich informational dynamics that interactions with an environment can induce. By relaxing the requirement for strict control and adopting a more active treatment of the environment, this thesis explores how these dynamics contribute to the emergence of classicality from quantum mechanics, and how it can change the internal information structure in quantum many-body systems. The study begins by addressing the challenges of controlling quantum systems near critical points, where conventional adiabatic methods become inefficient due to closing energy gaps. We propose a novel control strategy that applies counterdiabatic driving selectively within the impulse regime, as recognised by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. This reduces energetic costs while maintaining high fidelity. This approach is validated both numerically and analytically, demonstrating substantial energetic savings. Next, we explore control strategies relevant to implementing unitary gates in two distinct physical settings. The first involves analytically determining a Hamiltonian that achieves gate operations with unit fidelity without external control, while the second leverages an auxiliary qubit that requires external driving. Despite the latter scheme being more resource intensive, we show that the additional complexity of driving and controlling an auxiliary qubit can be advantageous when we subject the systems to decoherence. Moving beyond controlled systems, we examine the informational dynamics of quantum sys- tems subject to the influence of their environment. Here, we investigate scenarios in which systems transition from pure quantum states to classically objective states as predicted by quantum Dar- winism. By partitioning the environment into accessible and inaccessible parts, we reveal how the interplay between these partitions determines whether classical objectivity emerges or if the system equilibrates without the redundant encoding of the state of the system into the environment. Finally, we explore the competition between two sinks for local quantum information - decoher- ence and information scrambling. Information scrambling refers to the flow of initially accessible quantum information into complex many-body correlations within the system itself. Typical mea- sures of scrambling used in closed systems can fail to differentiate between the local information spreading throughout the degrees of freedom of the systems and the spreading of information due to decoherence. We introduce a method for probing information scrambling even in the presence of open system effects, demonstrating that the environment restructures remaining information, reducing the complexity of the system’s dynamics. Collectively, these findings provide a comprehensive framework for understanding information dynamics in open quantum systems, offering new strategies for preserving quantum coherence and diagnosing the impact of an environment on the structure of quantum information.

We apply the bounds to show that there exist entangled thermal states such that the parameter can be estimated with an error that decreases faster than 1/√𝑛, beating the standard quantum limit. This result governs Hamiltonians where an unknown scalar parameter (e.g., a component of a magnetic field) is coupled locally and identically to 𝑛 qubit sensors. In the high-temperature regime, our bounds allow for pinpointing the optimal estimation error, up to a constant prefactor. Our bounds generalize to joint estimations of multiple parameters.

This trend persists as quantum theory extends into other fields, including thermodynamics. One such assumption in thermodynamics is that conserved quantities, known as charges, commute. Lifting this assumption has led to a new subfield, noncommuting charges, at the intersection of quantum information and quantum thermodynamics. The work presented in this thesis identifies various effects of noncommuting charges and extends the topic to many-body physics and experiments. Initially, the field’s findings were conveyed in abstract information-theoretic terms. To transition these findings to experimental practice and tie them to many-body physics, constructing relevant Hamiltonians is essential. We introduce a method for constructing Hamiltonians that globally conserve noncommuting quantities while facilitating their local transport. Having demonstrated the testability of noncommuting-charge physics, we aim to delineate its effects. To do so, we construct analogous models that differ in whether their charges commute. We find that noncommuting models exhibit higher entanglement entropies. Since entanglement accompanies thermalization, our result challenges previous assertions that charges’ noncommutation hinders thermalization. Motivated by understanding noncommuting charges’ effects on entanglement, we introduce them into monitored quantum circuits. Monitored quantum circuits typically transition from a highly entangled volume-law phase to a less entangled area-law phase as one increases the rate of measurements. This holds for monitored quantum circuits with no charges and commuting ones. We find that by introducing noncommuting charges into monitored quantum circuits, the area-law phase becomes replaced with a critical phase. Since critical phases are characterized by long-range entanglement, this result reinforces entanglement enhancement by noncommuting charges. Finally, we revisit the puzzle of whether noncommuting charges promote or hinder thermalization. Most quantum many-body systems thermalize; some don’t. In those that don’t, what effect do noncommuting charges have? One type of system that does not thermalize is a system whose Hamiltonian has so-called dynamical symmetries (or spectrum-generating algebras). We find that noncommuting charges promote thermalization by reducing the dynamical symmetries in a system.","tags":null,"title":"Effects of noncommuting charges in quantum information and thermodynamics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Paul Duruisseau","Akram Touil","Sebastian Deffner"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1700611200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1694046780,"objectID":"1bb95738f8cc4ba08ac9825d7a080a33","permalink":"https://qtd-hub.umd.edu/publication/2023-duruisseau-touil-deffner/","publishdate":"2023-11-22T00:33:00.091248Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2023-duruisseau-touil-deffner/","section":"publication","summary":"Quantum Darwinism explains the emergence of classical objectivity within a quantum universe. However, to date most research in quantum Darwinism has focused on specific models and their stationary properties. To further our understanding of the quantum-to-classical transition it appears desirable to identify the general criteria a Hamiltonian has to fulfill to support classical reality. To this end, we categorize all models with 2-body interactions, and we show that only those with separable interaction of system and environment can support a pointer basis. We further show that ''perfect'' quantum Darwinism can only emerge if there are no intra-environmental interactions. Our analysis is complemented by the solution of the ensuing dynamics. We find that in systems that exhibit information scrambling, the dynamical emergence of classical objectivity is in direct competition with the non-local spread of quantum correlations.

We start by in- troducing the concept of action quantum speed limits (QSLs). Unlike conventional geometric methods, these QSLs intricately depend on the instantaneous speed, offering bounds on the min- imal time needed to connect states. The instantaneous speed along fixed trajectories is shown to be an important and optimisable degree of freedom, as exemplified through the thermalising qubit case. Beyond discussing the feasibility of geometric QSLs, we also critically examine their interpretation in terms of different metric choices. It is revealed that these open-system QSL times provide indications of optimality concerning geodesic paths, rather than being strict minimal time indicators. Distinguishability, based on distance metrics employed in deriving QSLs (in particular the Fisher information), is also the key concept in the field of metrology. We consider the use of open system dynamics as a model to explore parameter estimation. We investigate how the presence of correlation between measurement results affects the Fisher information. These correlations are introduced through a sequential measurement scheme, where the same probe is measured multiple times in succession without allowing for equilibration. We prove that, for there to be any advantage in precision as a result of these correlations, there must be information encoded into the system-environment interaction term related to the parameter that we are trying to estimate. To emphasise this, we consider the specific case of temperature estimation where the thermalisation rate of the probe contains additional information about the temperature. The sequential scheme can be viewed as a form of collisional quantum thermometry, which further allows additional freedoms in the protocol, e.g. by introducing stochasticity in the waiting time between collisions. We establish that incorporating randomness in this manner leads to a significant expansion of the parameter range for achieving advantages over typical equilibrium approaches to thermometry. Intriguingly, we demonstrate that in certain settings optimal measurements can be performed locally, highlighting the limited role of genuine quantum correlations in this advantage. Finally, we delve into the statistics of the work done on a quantum system via a two-point measurement scheme. The Shannon entropy of the work distribution is shown to possess a general upper bound tied to initial diagonal entropy and a distinct quantum term associated with the relative entropy of coherence. This approach is shown to capture signatures of underlying physics across diverse scenarios. In particular, through an in-depth exploration of the Aubry-André-Harper model, we illustrate how the entropy of the work distribution provides a useful tool for characterising the localisation transition. We further explore the use of the entropy of the work distribution as a tool for identifying the mobility edge in a generalised Aubry-André-Harper model. Collectively, these results provide a toolbox to assess the optimality, either in terms of the dynamical paths taken, utility for metrological tasks, or ability to spotlight relevant physical properties of the model, for the dynamics of complex quantum systems.

In the Ising case, we find sensitivity equivalent to that of an idealized two-level system, with peak thermometric performance obtained at a temperature that scales linearly in the applied control field, independent of the coupling strength and environment spectral features. By contrast, a richer thermometric response can be realized for Kondo impurities, since strong probe-environment entanglement can then develop.

Quantum fluctuation relations have emerged as a powerful guide to understanding nonequilibrium quantum thermodynamic processes, but they are challenging to probe experimentally due to requirements of the measurement protocols and limited access to the environment. In this talk I will show how we can use spins associated with the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond as a novel toolbox for quantum thermodynamics, thanks to the good control and coherence time, as well as our ability to tailor the interaction with a dissipative environment. As an example, I will show how we can employ repeated optical interactions to engineer a tunable dissipative channel which embodies an autonomous feedback process (Maxwell’s demon).

(ii) How does the strong system-bath interaction affect the device\u0026#39;s operation? (iii) What can we learn about the machine from current noise?

The latter has been the limiting factor for the available flux of atom lasers due to the large loss of atoms and the long evaporation times. Motivated by proposed fundamental tests of physics which require ultra-bright atom lasers, we developed a new approach to cooling atoms towards quantum degeneracy as an alternative to evaporative cooling. Our method relies on a self-acting one-way wall for atoms that operates away from thermal equilibrium. It uses the entropy of the photon, not its momentum, and realizes informational cooling at maximum efficiency. The method was demonstrated experimentally, and new improvements will utilize high-angular momentum states to achieve very large phase-space compression. Beyond cooling of atoms, a similar method is being used to efficiently separate isotopes for medicine at the non-profit Pointsman Foundation, www.pointsman.org.

First, we construct two models that are closely analogous but differ in whether their charges commute. We show analytically and numerically that the noncommuting-charge case has more entanglement. Hence charges' noncommutation can promote entanglement.","tags":["Entanglement entropy","Nonequilibrium statistical mechanics","Quantum entanglement","Quantum information theory","Quantum statistical mechanics","Quantum thermodynamics","Thermodynamics"],"title":"Non-Abelian symmetry can increase entanglement entropy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ainur Kazhybekova","Steve Campbell","Anthony Kiely"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1669334400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1670113980,"objectID":"cc97c482c9181f5a156eda80be999fd4","permalink":"https://qtd-hub.umd.edu/publication/2022-kazhybekova-campbell-kiely/","publishdate":"2022-11-25T00:33:00.091248Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022-kazhybekova-campbell-kiely/","section":"publication","summary":"We present a general protocol to control closed quantum systems that is based on minimising the adiabatic action. Using tools based on the geometry of quantum evolutions through the quantum adiabatic brachistochrone, we show that high fidelity control of the ground state of critical quantum systems can be achieved and requires only a reasonable approximation for the ground state spectral gap. We demonstrate our results for three widely applicable systems: the Landau-Zener, Ising, and fully connected spin models.","tags":null,"title":"Minimal action control method in quantum critical models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kanu Sinha","Peter W Milonni"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1665705600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1670113980,"objectID":"46ca59025a24d00a50cb3f42ca7b1bcc","permalink":"https://qtd-hub.umd.edu/publication/2022-sinha-milonni/","publishdate":"2022-12-04T00:32:59.853702Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022-sinha-milonni/","section":"publication","summary":"An expression is derived for the momentum diffusion constant due to photon scattering of a small polarizable particle in blackbody radiation, and is shown to be related to the long-wavelength collisional decoherence rate for such a particle in a thermal environment. We show how this diffusion constant appears in the steady-state photon emission rate of two dipoles induced by blackbody radiation. We consider in addition the Einstein–Hopf drag force on a small polarizable particle moving in a blackbody field, and derive its relativistic form from the Lorentz transformation of forces. We obtain an expression for the rate of change of the field energy density associated with changes in the particles' kinetic energies and relate it to the Kompaneets equation for the case of Compton scattering by thermalized electrons.","tags":null,"title":"Dipoles in blackbody radiation: momentum fluctuations, decoherence, and drag force","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Congratulations to our winners!
