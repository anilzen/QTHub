The refrigerator exploits an engineered three-body interaction between the target qubit and two auxiliary qudits coupled to thermal environments. The environments consist of microwave waveguides populated with synthesized thermal photons. The target qubit, if initially fully excited, reaches a steady-state excited-level population of $5\\times10^{-4} \\pm 5\\times10^{-4}$ (an effective temperature of 23.5~mK) in about 1.6~$\\mu$s.

We critically assess the thermometric capabilities of the impurity as a probe, when its coupling to the environment is of Ising or Kondo exchange type. In the Ising case, we find sensitivity equivalent to that of an idealized two-level system, with peak thermometric performance obtained at a temperature that scales linearly in the applied control field, independent of the coupling strength and environment spectral features. By contrast, a richer thermometric response can be realized for Kondo impurities, since strong probe-environment entanglement can then develop. At low temperatures, we uncover a regime with a universal thermometric response that is independent of microscopic details, controlled only by the low-energy spectral features of the environment. The many-body entanglement that develops in this regime means that low-temperature thermometry with a weakly applied control field is inherently less sensitive, while optimal sensitivity is recovered by suppressing the entanglement with stronger fields.","tags":null,"title":"Thermometry of quantum environments with impurity probes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anthony Kiely","Eoin O'Connor","Thomás Fogarty","Gabriel T.

Quantum fluctuation relations have emerged as a powerful guide to understanding nonequilibrium quantum thermodynamic processes, but they are challenging to probe experimentally due to requirements of the measurement protocols and limited access to the environment. In this talk I will show how we can use spins associated with the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond as a novel toolbox for quantum thermodynamics, thanks to the good control and coherence time, as well as our ability to tailor the interaction with a dissipative environment. As an example, I will show how we can employ repeated optical interactions to engineer a tunable dissipative channel which embodies an autonomous feedback process (Maxwell’s demon). In turns, this allows to measure generalized energy fluctuations relations in a qutrit system. 10:45 AM — 11:00 AM Coffee Break 11:00 AM — 11:45 AM Dvira Segal, University of Toronto The Quantum Absorption Refrigerator as a Case Study in Quantum Thermodynamics Rethinking the operation principles of thermal machines in the nanoscale and quantum domain, we focus on a continuous machine operating in steady state, the quantum absorption refrigerator, and examine three key questions: (i) What is the impact of coherences within the working fluid on the performance of the quantum machine? (ii) How does the strong system-bath interaction affect the device\u0026#39;s operation? (iii) What can we learn about the machine from current noise? To examine these topics, I will discuss open quantum system techniques, which we utilize and develop. I will then describe some results, focusing on principles. Finally, I will offer my perspective on the impact of research in theoretical quantum thermodynamics on related disciplines. 11:45 AM — 01:15 PM Group photo followed by lunch 01:15 PM — 02:00 PM Mark Raizen, UT Austin Controlling and Cooling of Atoms using Photon Entropy Production of quantum degenerate atomic gases relies on laser cooling and evaporative cooling. The latter has been the limiting factor for the available flux of atom lasers due to the large loss of atoms and the long evaporation times. Motivated by proposed fundamental tests of physics which require ultra-bright atom lasers, we developed a new approach to cooling atoms towards quantum degeneracy as an alternative to evaporative cooling. Our method relies on a self-acting one-way wall for atoms that operates away from thermal equilibrium. It uses the entropy of the photon, not its momentum, and realizes informational cooling at maximum efficiency. The method was demonstrated experimentally, and new improvements will utilize high-angular momentum states to achieve very large phase-space compression. Beyond cooling of atoms, a similar method is being used to efficiently separate isotopes for medicine at the non-profit Pointsman Foundation, www.pointsman.org. This work illustrates the utility of controlling and sorting atoms to benefit humanity. 02:00 PM — 02:15 PM Coffee Break 02:15 PM — 03:00 PM Sean Carroll, JHU Philosophical Issues in Quantum Thermodynamics Quantum mechanics and thermodynamics, individually, are two areas of physics where foundational issues loom large.

Bridging quantum thermodynamics to many-body physics, we quantify the effects of charges' noncommutation—of a symmetry's non-Abelian nature—on Page curves. First, we construct two models that are closely analogous but differ in whether their charges commute. We show analytically and numerically that the noncommuting-charge case has more entanglement. Hence charges' noncommutation can promote entanglement.","tags":["Entanglement entropy","Nonequilibrium statistical mechanics","Quantum entanglement","Quantum information theory","Quantum statistical mechanics","Quantum thermodynamics","Thermodynamics"],"title":"Non-Abelian symmetry can increase entanglement entropy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maxwell Aifer","Nathan Myers","Sebastian Deffner"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1669852800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1670113980,"objectID":"8090255058974ff4dec75305087f088a","permalink":"https://qtd-hub.umd.edu/publication/2022-aifer-myers-deffner/","publishdate":"2022-12-04T00:33:00.091248Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022-aifer-myers-deffner/","section":"publication","summary":"Among the emerging technologies with prophesied quantum advantage, quantum communications has already led to fascinating demonstrations -- including quantum teleportation to and from satellites. However, all optical communication necessitates the use of optical devices, and their comprehensive quantum thermodynamic description is still severely lacking. In the present analysis we prove several versions of Landauer's principle for noisy polarizers, namely absorbing linear polarizers and polarizing beamsplitters. As main results we obtain statements of the second law quantifying the minimal amount of heat that is dissipated in the creating of linearly polarized light. Our findings are illustrated with an experimentally tractable example, namely the temperature dependence of a quantum eraser.","tags":["Quantum Physics (quant-ph)","Optics (physics.optics)","FOS: Physical sciences","FOS: Physical sciences"],"title":"Thermodynamics of quantum information in noisy polarizers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ainur Kazhybekova","Steve Campbell","Anthony Kiely"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1669334400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1670113980,"objectID":"cc97c482c9181f5a156eda80be999fd4","permalink":"https://qtd-hub.umd.edu/publication/2022-kazhybekova-campbell-kiely/","publishdate":"2022-11-25T00:33:00.091248Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022-kazhybekova-campbell-kiely/","section":"publication","summary":"We present a general protocol to control closed quantum systems that is based on minimising the adiabatic action. Using tools based on the geometry of quantum evolutions through the quantum adiabatic brachistochrone, we show that high fidelity control of the ground state of critical quantum systems can be achieved and requires only a reasonable approximation for the ground state spectral gap. We demonstrate our results for three widely applicable systems: the Landau-Zener, Ising, and fully connected spin models.","tags":null,"title":"Minimal action control method in quantum critical models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kanu Sinha","Peter W Milonni"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1665705600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1670113980,"objectID":"46ca59025a24d00a50cb3f42ca7b1bcc","permalink":"https://qtd-hub.umd.edu/publication/2022-sinha-milonni/","publishdate":"2022-12-04T00:32:59.853702Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022-sinha-milonni/","section":"publication","summary":"An expression is derived for the momentum diffusion constant due to photon scattering of a small polarizable particle in blackbody radiation, and is shown to be related to the long-wavelength collisional decoherence rate for such a particle in a thermal environment. We show how this diffusion constant appears in the steady-state photon emission rate of two dipoles induced by blackbody radiation. We consider in addition the Einstein–Hopf drag force on a small polarizable particle moving in a blackbody field, and derive its relativistic form from the Lorentz transformation of forces. We obtain an expression for the rate of change of the field energy density associated with changes in the particles' kinetic energies and relate it to the Kompaneets equation for the case of Compton scattering by thermalized electrons.","tags":[],"title":"Dipoles in blackbody radiation: momentum fluctuations, decoherence, and drag force\n","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Akira Sone","Diogo O.

The resulting second law of thermodynamics for the net entropy production is tighter bounded by the quantum mutual information of the conditional thermal state, which is a thermal state conditioned on the initial energy measurement. These results elucidate the role of quantum correlations in the heat exchange between multiple subsystems interacting with arbitrary coupling strengths.
