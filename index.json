The incompatibility of observables is one crucial difference between classical and quantum mechanics. Thermodynamic laws must apply across classical and quantum systems. Historically, researchers have implicitly assumed that conserved quantities in thermodynamic systems commute with each other. When we remove this assumption, conserved quantities that fail to commute with each other in thermodynamics engender new physics. One seminal result in thermodynamics for closed quantum many-body systems is the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which explains how a quantum many-body system thermalizes internally. The ETH applies across many fields including atomic, molecular, and optical physics, condensed-matter physics, and high-energy physics. Murthy et al. recently showed that the ETH does not apply to systems with noncommuting conserved quantities. Murthy et al. posited a non-Abelian ETH to account for systems with noncommuting conserved quantities. We calculate numerics to support the non-Abelian ETH. We model a one-dimensional (1D) next-nearest-neighbor Heisenberg chain of 18 qubits. We represent local operators with matrices relative to an energy eigenbasis. Our numerics evidence the non-Abelian ETH’s qualitative predictions. Noh et al. also recently derived a fluctation-dissipation theorem (FDT) from the ETH. With the recently proposed non-Abelian ETH, we begin numerical calculations in support of an FDT derived from the non- Abelian ETH. We offer the first comprehensive numerical tests of the non-Abelian ETH and initial numerics for deriving an FDT for systems that follow the NAETH.","tags":null,"title":"Numerical evidence for the non-Abelian eigenstate thermalization hypothesis and a non-Abelian fluctuation-dissipation theorem","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fabio Anzà","Steve Campbell","Sebastian Deffner","Christopher Jarzynski","Amir Kalev","Kanu Sinha","Nicole Yunger Halpern"],"categories":null,"content":" Register here Co-hosted by the Quantum Science Institute.\nInvited Speakers Jacob A.

Barandes Harvard University\nStatistical Mechanics with Stochastic Dynamics There are a number of deep questions at the foundations of statistical mechanics, including the rigorous justification of its probability distributions, the limitations of ergodicity, the origins of the thermodynamic arrow of time, and the precise intertheoretic reduction of classical thermodynamics to quantum mechanics. In this talk, I will argue that a new approach to formulating quantum theory in terms of ‘indivisible’ stochastic dynamics may provide new resources for answering these questions, as well as for related problems, like making microphysical sense of causal influences. By employing this new indivisible formulation, I will also show how to use simple thermodynamic systems to build real-world analog models of quantum systems, like qubits.\nCeren B. Dag Indiana University Bloomington\nQuantum scarring in many-body quantum systems Quantum scars, introduced within the context of single-particle billiard model in 1984, are quantum eigenstates with an enhanced probability density around an unstable periodic orbit (UPO) in a chaotic phase space. Recently, nonthermal many-body eigenstates embedded in an otherwise thermal spectrum have been identified as a many-body generalization of quantum scars. This concept, however, is not associated to a chaotic phase space, and hence the connection between the single- and many-body notions of quantum scars had remained incomplete. In this talk, I will present the first quantum many-body scars originating from UPOs of a chaotic phase space in different spin models. These states verify the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, and we thus refer to them as thermal quantum many-body scars. While they do not preclude thermalization, their spectral structure featuring approximately equispaced towers of states yields an anomalous oscillatory dynamics preceding thermalization for wavepackets initialized on a UPO. I will highlight a particular spin-1 chain which hosts both types of scars, thermal and nonthermal where the latter is associated with stable periodic orbits. Time permitting, I will also provide evidence for the ubiquity of scarred quantum eigenstates in a generic spin-1/2 chain, and how scarring makes the system more likely to be found on an orbit it was initialized on, retaining a memory of its past.\nPhysical Review Letters 132 (2), 020401 (2024).

In this talk I will describe the standard trapped ion toolkit for quantum simulation - the contemporary ways in which both the ion’s valence electronic state and the ions harmonic motion (i.e. phonons) are controlled in the lab. Additionally, I will present a short description of the early QTD experiments which used this toolkit and preview the means of expanding the toolkit, presently being pursued in my lab and others. Time allowing, I will briefly compare trapped ion simulators to other simulation platforms and/or comment on trapped ion quantum computers as tools for experimental QTD.\nEduardo Martin-Martinez University of Waterloo\nTowards Quantum Field Thermodynamics: Observational Entropy and Operational Definitions of Work and Heat We will review the notions of internal energy and work distributions in quantum field theory (QFT), highlighting the limitations of extending standard thermodynamic definitions—many of them originally developed for finite-dimensional quantum systems—to the infinite-dimensional, local setting of QFT. Following this review, we will argue for a reformulation of thermodynamic concepts such as work, heat, and entropy within the algebraic framework of von Neumann algebras, which is the language that naturally encodes the operational and localization structure of QFT. This shift is essential for constructing a physically meaningful extension of quantum thermodynamics beyond finite systems, particularly in addressing the inadequacy of the von Neumann entropy to capture thermodynamic behavior in scenarios involving coarse-grained observations or limited resolution. Within this framework, we introduce a generalization of observational entropy for systems with a richer set of controllable degrees of freedom.\nIman Marvian Duke …","date":1748350800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1748350800,"objectID":"71c73358f9535bd2e7e5aae444c10361","permalink":"https://qtd-hub.umd.edu/event/symposium-2025/","publishdate":"2025-03-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/event/symposium-2025/","section":"event","summary":"Quantum-Thermodynamics Symposium at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County","tags":[],"title":"Maryland Quantum-Thermodynamics Symposium 2025 and first annual Quantum Workshop at UMBC","type":"event"},{"authors":["Moallison F.

This means that these eigenstates are extremely sensitive to all the parameters of the Hamiltonian. In practical settings, there always exists a degree of experimental uncertainty in the control parameters - which are approximately known quantities. Despite such uncertainties representing the most relevant source of noise in critical metrology, their impact on the attainable precision has been largely overlooked. In this work we present a general framework, interpolating between the single and multi-parameter estimation settings, allowing for the proper bookkeeping of relevant errors. We apply this framework to the paradigmatic transverse field Ising and Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick models, explicitly showing how uncertainty in control parameters impacts the sensitivity of critical sensors. For finite-size systems, we establish that there exists a trade-off between the amount of uncertainty a many-body probe can withstand while still maintaining a quantum advantage in parameter estimation.","tags":null,"title":"Uncertain Quantum Critical Metrology: From Single to Multi Parameter Sensing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sagar Silva Pratapsi","Sebastian Deffner","Stefano Gherardini"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1747267200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1749099600,"objectID":"d9e47adca1940ca8a18672f5127c6d0a","permalink":"https://qtd-hub.umd.edu/publication/2025-pratapsi-deffner-gherardini/","publishdate":"2025-05-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2025-pratapsi-deffner-gherardini/","section":"publication","summary":"What is the minimal time until a quantum system can exhibit genuine quantum features? To answer this question we derive quantum speed limits for two-time correlation functions arising from statistics of measurements. Generally, these two-time correlators are described by quasiprobabilities, if the initial quantum state of the system does not commute with the measurement observables. Our quantum speed limits are derived from the Heisenberg-Robertson uncertainty relation, and set the minimal time at which a quasiprobability can become non-positive, which is evidence for the onset of non-classical traits in the system dynamics. As an illustrative example, we apply these results to a conditional quantum gate, by determining the optimal condition giving rise to non-classicality at maximum speed.

For example, one of the hallmarks of quantum mechanics is that observables may be incompatible, implying among other things that it is not always possible to find joint probability distributions which fully capture the joint statistics of multiple measurements. Instead, one must employ more general tools such as the Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability (KDQ) distribution, which may exhibit negative or non-real values heralding non-classicality. In this Letter, we consider the KDQ distributions describing arbitrary collections of measurements on disjoint components of some generic multipartite system. We show that the system dynamics ensures that these distributions are classical if and only if the Hamiltonian supports Quantum Darwinism. Thus, we demonstrate a fundamental relationship between these two notions of classicality and their emergence in the quantum world.","tags":null,"title":"Compatibility of Quantum Measurements and the Emergence of Classical Objectivity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Steve Campbell","Irene D'Amico","Mario A.

In many practical scenarios, where more than one parameter is unknown, the multi-parameter Cram'er-Rao bound (CRB) applies.

In this paper, we examine the physical origins of such singularities, showing that they result from an over-parametrization on the metrological level. This is itself caused by emergent metrological symmetries, whereby the same set of measurement outcomes are obtained for different combinations of system parameters. Although the number of effective parameters is equal to the number of non-zero QFIM eigenvalues, the Cram'er-Rao formalism typically does not provide information about the effective parameter encoding. Instead, we demonstrate through a series of concrete examples that Bayesian estimation can provide deep insights. In particular, the metrological symmetries appear in the Bayesian posterior distribution as lines of persistent likelihood running through the space of unknown parameters. These lines are contour lines of the effective parameters which, through suitable parameter transformations, can be estimated and follow their own effective CRBs.","tags":null,"title":"Metrological symmetries in singular quantum multi-parameter estimation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zohreh Davoudi","Christopher Jarzynski","Niklas Mueller","Greeshma Oruganti","Connor Powers","Nicole Yunger Halpern"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1740528e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1740616380,"objectID":"00d10436d1502ac8923434c740e16ed0","permalink":"https://qtd-hub.umd.edu/publication/2025-davoudi-jarzynski-mueller-oruganti-powers-halpern/","publishdate":"2025-02-26T00:33:00.091248Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2025-davoudi-jarzynski-mueller-oruganti-powers-halpern/","section":"publication","summary":"How should one define thermodynamic quantities (internal energy, work, heat, etc.) for quantum systems coupled to their environments strongly?

Instead, recent years have seen the Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) distribution come to the forefront as a powerful quasi-probability distribution for analysing quantum mechanics. The KD distribution allows tools from statistics and probability theory to be applied to problems in quantum-information processing. A notable difference to the Wigner function is that the KD distribution can represent a quantum state in terms of arbitrary observables. This paper reviews the KD distribution, in three parts. First, we present definitions and basic properties of the KD distribution and its generalisations. Second, we summarise the KD distribution's extensive usage in the study or development of measurement disturbance; quantum metrology; weak values; direct measurements of quantum states; quantum thermodynamics; quantum scrambling and out-of-time-ordered correlators; and the foundations of quantum mechanics, including Leggett-Garg inequalities, the consistent-histories interpretation, and contextuality. We emphasise connections between operational quantum advantages and negative or non-real KD quasi-probabilities. Third, we delve into the KD distribution's mathematical structure.

Quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories holds promise for overcoming computational limitations. Because of local constraints (Gauss’s laws), lattice gauge theories have an intricate Hilbert-space structure. This structure complicates the definition of thermodynamic properties of systems coupled to reservoirs during equilibrium and nonequilibrium processes. We show how to define thermodynamic quantities such as work and heat using strong-coupling thermodynamics, a framework that has recently burgeoned within the field of quantum thermodynamics. Our definitions suit instantaneous quenches, simple nonequilibrium processes undertaken in quantum simulators. To illustrate our framework, we compute the work and heat exchanged during a quench in a lattice gauge theory coupled to matter in dimensions. The thermodynamic quantities, as functions of the quench parameter, evidence a phase transition.

In particular, we investigate information-to-work conversion over the quantum-to-classical transition. The demon continuously measures the charge state of a double quantum dot and uses this information to guide electrons against a voltage bias by tuning the on-site energies of the dots. Coherent tunneling between the dots allows for the buildup of quantum coherence in the system. Under strong measurements, the coherence is suppressed, and the system is well-described by a classical model. As the measurement strength is further increased, the Zeno effect prohibits interdot tunneling. A Zeno-like effect is also observed for weak measurements, where measurement errors lead to fluctuations in the on-site energies, dephasing the system.

Which fundamental conditions are necessary for realizing useful autonomous quantum machines? Inspired by recent quantum thermodynamics and chemistry, we posit conditions analogous to DiVincenzo's criteria for quantum computing. Furthermore, we illustrate the criteria with multiple autonomous quantum machines (refrigerators, circuits, clocks, etc.) and multiple candidate platforms (neutral atoms, molecules, superconducting qubits, etc.). Our criteria are intended to foment and guide the development of useful autonomous quantum machines.","tags":null,"title":"Key issues review: useful autonomous quantum machines","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Akira Sone","Kanu Sinha","Sebastian Deffner"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1727913600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1728001980,"objectID":"65ae239d6a3f807b97267a55e3b32d24","permalink":"https://qtd-hub.umd.edu/publication/2024-sone-sinha-deffner/","publishdate":"2024-10-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2024-sone-sinha-deffner/","section":"publication","summary":"What is the major difference between large and small systems?

Often, the charges are assumed to commute with each other (e.g., energy and particle number). Yet quantum charges can fail to commute. Noncommutation invites generalizations, which we posit and justify, of the three formulas. The noncommutation of charges, we find, breaks the equivalence of the formulas. Furthermore, different formulas quantify different physical effects of the noncommutation of charges on entropy production. For instance, entropy production can signal contextuality—true nonclassicality—by becoming nonreal.

In our study, we utilize D-Wave hybrid solvers that implement classical heuristics with potential assistance from a quantum processing unit.

Our analysis focuses on a practical, business-oriented scenario: scheduling AGVs within a factory constrained by limited space, simulating a realistic production setting. Our approach maps a realistic AGVs problem onto one reminiscent of railway scheduling and demonstrates that the AGVs problem is better suited to quantum computing than its railway counterpart, the latter being denser in terms of the average number of constraints per variable.

To prevent this loss, it is crucial to develop strategies that enable the rapid and precise control of quantum systems, ensuring that desired processes are com- pleted faster than decoherence times. From a control perspective, the environment is viewed as a disruptive force; however, this ignores the rich informational dynamics that interactions with an environment can induce. By relaxing the requirement for strict control and adopting a more active treatment of the environment, this thesis explores how these dynamics contribute to the emergence of classicality from quantum mechanics, and how it can change the internal information structure in quantum many-body systems. The study begins by addressing the challenges of controlling quantum systems near critical points, where conventional adiabatic methods become inefficient due to closing energy gaps. We propose a novel control strategy that applies counterdiabatic driving selectively within the impulse regime, as recognised by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. This reduces energetic costs while maintaining high fidelity. This approach is validated both numerically and analytically, demonstrating substantial energetic savings. Next, we explore control strategies relevant to implementing unitary gates in two distinct physical settings. The first involves analytically determining a Hamiltonian that achieves gate operations with unit fidelity without external control, while the second leverages an auxiliary qubit that requires external driving. Despite the latter scheme being more resource intensive, we show that the additional complexity of driving and controlling an auxiliary qubit can be advantageous when we subject the systems to decoherence. Moving beyond controlled systems, we examine the informational dynamics of quantum sys- tems subject to the influence of their environment. Here, we investigate scenarios in which systems transition from pure quantum states to classically objective states as predicted by quantum Dar- winism. By partitioning the environment into accessible and inaccessible parts, we reveal how the interplay between these partitions determines whether classical objectivity emerges or if the system equilibrates without the redundant encoding of the state of the system into the environment. Finally, we explore the competition between two sinks for local quantum information - decoher- ence and information scrambling. Information scrambling refers to the flow of initially accessible quantum information into complex many-body correlations within the system itself. Typical mea- sures of scrambling used in closed systems can fail to differentiate between the local information spreading throughout the degrees of freedom of the systems and the spreading of information due to decoherence. We introduce a method for probing information scrambling even in the presence of open system effects, demonstrating that the environment restructures remaining information, reducing the complexity of the system’s dynamics. Collectively, these findings provide a comprehensive framework for understanding information dynamics in open quantum systems, offering new strategies for preserving quantum coherence and diagnosing the impact of an environment on the structure of quantum information.

We apply the bounds to show that there exist entangled thermal states such that the parameter can be estimated with an error that decreases faster than 1/√𝑛, beating the standard quantum limit. This result governs Hamiltonians where an unknown scalar parameter (e.g., a component of a magnetic field) is coupled locally and identically to 𝑛 qubit sensors. In the high-temperature regime, our bounds allow for pinpointing the optimal estimation error, up to a constant prefactor. Our bounds generalize to joint estimations of multiple parameters.

In particular, the delicacy of critical systems to perturbations can make them ideal sensors. Arguably the simplest realistic probe system is a spin-1/2 impurity, which can be manipulated and measured in-situ when embedded in a fermionic environment. Although entanglement between a single impurity probe and its environment produces nontrivial many-body effects, criticality cannot be leveraged for sensing. Here we introduce instead the two-impurity Kondo (2IK) model as a novel paradigm for critical quantum metrology, and examine the multiparameter estimation scenario at finite temperature. We explore the full metrological phase diagram numerically and obtain exact analytic results near criticality. Enhanced sensitivity to the inter-impurity coupling driving a second-order phase transition is evidenced by diverging quantum Fisher information (QFI) and quantum signal-to-noise ratio (QSNR).

This trend persists as quantum theory extends into other fields, including thermodynamics. One such assumption in thermodynamics is that conserved quantities, known as charges, commute. Lifting this assumption has led to a new subfield, noncommuting charges, at the intersection of quantum information and quantum thermodynamics. The work presented in this thesis identifies various effects of noncommuting charges and extends the topic to many-body physics and experiments. Initially, the field’s findings were conveyed in abstract information-theoretic terms. To transition these findings to experimental practice and tie them to many-body physics, constructing relevant Hamiltonians is essential. We introduce a method for constructing Hamiltonians that globally conserve noncommuting quantities while facilitating their local transport. Having demonstrated the testability of noncommuting-charge physics, we aim to delineate its effects. To do so, we construct analogous models that differ in whether their charges commute. We find that noncommuting models exhibit higher entanglement entropies. Since entanglement accompanies thermalization, our result challenges previous assertions that charges’ noncommutation hinders thermalization. Motivated by understanding noncommuting charges’ effects on entanglement, we introduce them into monitored quantum circuits. Monitored quantum circuits typically transition from a highly entangled volume-law phase to a less entangled area-law phase as one increases the rate of measurements. This holds for monitored quantum circuits with no charges and commuting ones. We find that by introducing noncommuting charges into monitored quantum circuits, the area-law phase becomes replaced with a critical phase. Since critical phases are characterized by long-range entanglement, this result reinforces entanglement enhancement by noncommuting charges. Finally, we revisit the puzzle of whether noncommuting charges promote or hinder thermalization. Most quantum many-body systems thermalize; some don’t. In those that don’t, what effect do noncommuting charges have? One type of system that does not thermalize is a system whose Hamiltonian has so-called dynamical symmetries (or spectrum-generating algebras). We find that noncommuting charges promote thermalization by reducing the dynamical symmetries in a system.","tags":null,"title":"Effects of noncommuting charges in quantum information and thermodynamics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Paul Duruisseau","Akram Touil","Sebastian Deffner"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1700611200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1694046780,"objectID":"1bb95738f8cc4ba08ac9825d7a080a33","permalink":"https://qtd-hub.umd.edu/publication/2023-duruisseau-touil-deffner/","publishdate":"2023-11-22T00:33:00.091248Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2023-duruisseau-touil-deffner/","section":"publication","summary":"Quantum Darwinism explains the emergence of classical objectivity within a quantum universe.

To this end, we categorize all models with 2-body interactions, and we show that only those with separable interaction of system and environment can support a pointer basis. We further show that ''perfect'' quantum Darwinism can only emerge if there are no intra-environmental interactions. Our analysis is complemented by the solution of the ensuing dynamics.

We start by in- troducing the concept of action quantum speed limits (QSLs). Unlike conventional geometric methods, these QSLs intricately depend on the instantaneous speed, offering bounds on the min- imal time needed to connect states. The instantaneous speed along fixed trajectories is shown to be an important and optimisable degree of freedom, as exemplified through the thermalising qubit case. Beyond discussing the feasibility of geometric QSLs, we also critically examine their interpretation in terms of different metric choices. It is revealed that these open-system QSL times provide indications of optimality concerning geodesic paths, rather than being strict minimal time indicators. Distinguishability, based on distance metrics employed in deriving QSLs (in particular the Fisher information), is also the key concept in the field of metrology. We consider the use of open system dynamics as a model to explore parameter estimation. We investigate how the presence of correlation between measurement results affects the Fisher information. These correlations are introduced through a sequential measurement scheme, where the same probe is measured multiple times in succession without allowing for equilibration. We prove that, for there to be any advantage in precision as a result of these correlations, there must be information encoded into the system-environment interaction term related to the parameter that we are trying to estimate. To emphasise this, we consider the specific case of temperature estimation where the thermalisation rate of the probe contains additional information about the temperature. The sequential scheme can be viewed as a form of collisional quantum thermometry, which further allows additional freedoms in the protocol, e.g. by introducing stochasticity in the waiting time between collisions. We establish that incorporating randomness in this manner leads to a significant expansion of the parameter range for achieving advantages over typical equilibrium approaches to thermometry. Intriguingly, we demonstrate that in certain settings optimal measurements can be performed locally, highlighting the limited role of genuine quantum correlations in this advantage. Finally, we delve into the statistics of the work done on a quantum system via a two-point measurement scheme. The Shannon entropy of the work distribution is shown to possess a general upper bound tied to initial diagonal entropy and a distinct quantum term associated with the relative entropy of coherence. This approach is shown to capture signatures of underlying physics across diverse scenarios. In particular, through an in-depth exploration of the Aubry-André-Harper model, we illustrate how the entropy of the work distribution provides a useful tool for characterising the localisation transition. We further explore the use of the entropy of the work distribution as a tool for identifying the mobility edge in a generalised Aubry-André-Harper model. Collectively, these results provide a toolbox to assess the optimality, either in terms of the dynamical paths taken, utility for metrological tasks, or ability to spotlight relevant physical properties of the model, for the dynamics of complex quantum systems.

We show how the Shannon entropy of the work distribution admits a general upper bound depending on the initial diagonal entropy, and a purely quantum term associated to the relative entropy of coherence. We demonstrate that this approach captures strong signatures of the underlying physics in a diverse range of settings. In particular, we carry out a detailed study of the Aubry-André-Harper model and show that the entropy of the work distribution conveys very clearly the physics of the localization transition, which is not apparent from the statistical moments.","tags":null,"title":"Entropy of the quantum work distribution","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sebastian Deffner","Christopher Jarzynski"],"categories":null,"content":"Description The Maryland Quantum-Thermodynamics Hub will hold its first symposium on Pi Day, 2023. This one-day event’s aim is to cover recent advances in quantum thermodynamics broadly while fostering new collaborations. The symposium will include four invited speakers, lightning talks, and ample time for discussions. The talks will also be streamed on Zoom.\nConference Photo Schedule Time Event 9:00 AM — 9:45 AM Cofee and Breakfast 9:45 AM — 10:00 AM Welcome \u0026amp; Overview of Hub 10:00 AM — 10:45 AM Paola Cappellaro, MIT An Experimental Toolbox for Quantum Thermodynamics Elucidating the laws of thermodynamics at their most fundamental level requires clarifying the thermodynamic properties of quantum systems, and especially the contributions of coherence and correlations in the concept of work and heat transfer. Quantum fluctuation relations have emerged as a powerful guide to understanding nonequilibrium quantum thermodynamic processes, but they are challenging to probe experimentally due to requirements of the measurement protocols and limited access to the environment. In this talk I will show how we can use spins associated with the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond as a novel toolbox for quantum thermodynamics, thanks to the good control and coherence time, as well as our ability to tailor the interaction with a dissipative environment. As an example, I will show how we can employ repeated optical interactions to engineer a tunable dissipative channel which embodies an autonomous feedback process (Maxwell’s demon). In turns, this allows to measure generalized energy fluctuations relations in a qutrit system. 10:45 AM — 11:00 AM Coffee Break 11:00 AM — 11:45 AM Dvira Segal, University of Toronto The Quantum Absorption Refrigerator as a Case Study in Quantum Thermodynamics Rethinking the operation principles of thermal machines in the nanoscale and quantum domain, we focus on a continuous machine operating in steady state, the quantum absorption refrigerator, and examine three key questions: (i) What is the impact of coherences within the working fluid on the performance of the quantum machine? (ii) How does the strong system-bath interaction affect the device\u0026#39;s operation? (iii) What can we learn about the machine from current noise? To examine these topics, I will discuss open quantum system techniques, which we utilize and develop. I will then describe some results, focusing on principles. Finally, I will offer my perspective on the impact of research in theoretical quantum thermodynamics on related disciplines. 11:45 AM — 01:15 PM Group photo followed by lunch 01:15 PM — 02:00 PM Mark Raizen, UT Austin Controlling and Cooling of Atoms using Photon Entropy Production of quantum degenerate atomic gases relies on laser cooling and evaporative cooling. The latter has been the limiting factor for the available flux of atom lasers due to the large loss of atoms and the long evaporation times. Motivated by proposed fundamental tests of physics which require ultra-bright atom lasers, we developed a new approach to cooling atoms towards quantum degeneracy as an alternative to evaporative cooling. Our method relies on a self-acting one-way wall for atoms that operates away from thermal equilibrium. It uses the entropy of the photon, not its momentum, and realizes informational cooling at maximum efficiency. The method was demonstrated experimentally, and new improvements will utilize high-angular momentum states to achieve very large phase-space compression. Beyond cooling of atoms, a similar method is being used to efficiently separate isotopes for medicine at the non-profit Pointsman Foundation, www.pointsman.org. This work illustrates the utility of controlling and sorting atoms to benefit humanity. 02:00 PM — 02:15 PM Coffee Break 02:15 PM — 03:00 PM Sean Carroll, JHU Philosophical Issues in Quantum Thermodynamics Quantum mechanics and thermodynamics, individually, are two areas of physics where foundational issues loom large. It stands to reason that their overlap would raise particularly pressing questions, but that specific territory is largely unexplored. I will introduce the most important foundational ideas in both QM and thermo, discuss how they might be brought together, and speculate on connections to cosmology and other fields. 03:00 PM — 03:15 PM Coffee Break 03:15 PM — 04:00 PM Lightning Talks 04:00 PM — 06:00 PM Poster Session 06:00 PM End of Symposium Directions to the Symposium The symposium will be held in Room 1103 of the Biosciences Research Building (BRB) at the University of Maryland, College Park.

We focus on the non-Gaussianity of the distribution, which we characterize through two quantitative metrics: skewness and negentropy. In particular, we focus on the quantum Ising model and show that a finite duration of the ramp enhances the non-Gaussianity of the distribution for a finite size system. By examining the characteristics of the full distribution, we observe that there is a clear intermediate regime between the sudden quench and adiabatic limits, where the distribution becomes increasingly skewed.","tags":["Nonequilibrium \u0026 irreversible thermodynamics","Nonequilibrium statistical mechanics","Quantum phase transitions","Quantum statistical mechanics","Quantum thermodynamics"],"title":"Non-Gaussian work statistics at finite-time driving","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Emily E.

Yet, they are also utterly inaccessible to experimentation, and even just indirect observation poses significant technical challenges. The phenomenological approach of thermodynamics is uniquely suited to explore at least some of the physical properties of such scenarios, and this has motivated the study of so-called holographic engines. We show that the efficiency of an endoreversible Brayton cycle is given by the Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency if the engine is fueled by a 2-dimensional ideal gas; and that the efficiency is higher, if the working medium is a (2+1)-dimensional BTZ black hole. These findings may be relevant not only in the quest to unlock the mysteries of black holes, but also for potential technological applications of graphene.","tags":[],"title":"Boosting thermodynamic performance by bending space-time","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shayan Majidy","Aleksander Lasek","David A.

The Page curve quantifies the bipartite entanglement of a many-body system in a random pure state. This entanglement is known to decrease if one constrains extensive observables that commute with each other (Abelian “charges”). Non-Abelian charges, which fail to commute with each other, are of current interest in quantum thermodynamics. For example, noncommuting charges were shown to reduce entropy-production rates and may enhance finite-size deviations from eigenstate thermalization. Bridging quantum thermodynamics to many-body physics, we quantify the effects of charges' noncommutation—of a symmetry's non-Abelian nature—on Page curves. First, we construct two models that are closely analogous but differ in whether their charges commute. We show analytically and numerically that the noncommuting-charge case has more entanglement. Hence charges' noncommutation can promote entanglement.","tags":["Entanglement entropy","Nonequilibrium statistical mechanics","Quantum entanglement","Quantum information theory","Quantum statistical mechanics","Quantum thermodynamics","Thermodynamics"],"title":"Non-Abelian symmetry can increase entanglement entropy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ainur Kazhybekova","Steve Campbell","Anthony Kiely"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1669334400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1670113980,"objectID":"cc97c482c9181f5a156eda80be999fd4","permalink":"https://qtd-hub.umd.edu/publication/2022-kazhybekova-campbell-kiely/","publishdate":"2022-11-25T00:33:00.091248Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022-kazhybekova-campbell-kiely/","section":"publication","summary":"We present a general protocol to control closed quantum systems that is based on minimising the adiabatic action.
