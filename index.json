The process is driven by a thermal gradient and is autonomous, requiring no external feedback. The refrigerator exploits an engineered three-body interaction between the target qubit and two auxiliary qudits. Each auxiliary qudit is coupled to a physical heat bath, realized with a microwave waveguide populated with synthesized quasithermal radiation. If the target qubit is initially fully excited, its effective temperature reaches a steady-state level of approximately 22 mK, lower than what can be achieved by existing state-of-the-art reset protocols.

Classical computing methods, via the framework of lattice gauge theory, have experienced limited success in this mission. Quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories holds promise for overcoming computational limitations. Because of local constraints (Gauss’s laws), lattice gauge theories have an intricate Hilbert-space structure. This structure complicates the definition of thermodynamic properties of systems coupled to reservoirs during equilibrium and nonequilibrium processes. We show how to define thermodynamic quantities such as work and heat using strong-coupling thermodynamics, a framework that has recently burgeoned within the field of quantum thermodynamics. Our definitions suit instantaneous quenches, simple nonequilibrium processes undertaken in quantum simulators. To illustrate our framework, we compute the work and heat exchanged during a quench in a lattice gauge theory coupled to matter in dimensions. The thermodynamic quantities, as functions of the quench parameter, evidence a phase transition. For general thermal states, we derive a simple relation between a quantum many-body system’s entanglement Hamiltonian, measurable with quantum-information-processing tools, and the Hamiltonian of mean force, used to define strong-coupling thermodynamic quantities.","tags":null,"title":"Quantum thermodynamics of nonequilibrium processes in lattice gauge theories","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Emery Doucet","Sebastian Deffner"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1733875200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1714609980,"objectID":"7d38832944314b4a55cf68eaf00dc452","permalink":"https://qtd-hub.umd.edu/publication/2024-doucet-deffner/","publishdate":"2024-05-01T00:33:00.091248Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2024-doucet-deffner/","section":"publication","summary":"Quantum Darwinism is a paradigm to understand how classically objective reality emerges from within a fundamentally quantum universe.

This has been studied in the classical as well as the quantum domain. In this paper, we study an implementation of Maxwell's demon that can operate in both domains. In particular, we investigate information-to-work conversion over the quantum-to-classical transition. The demon continuously measures the charge state of a double quantum dot and uses this information to guide electrons against a voltage bias by tuning the on-site energies of the dots. Coherent tunneling between the dots allows for the buildup of quantum coherence in the system. Under strong measurements, the coherence is suppressed, and the system is well-described by a classical model. As the measurement strength is further increased, the Zeno effect prohibits interdot tunneling. A Zeno-like effect is also observed for weak measurements, where measurement errors lead to fluctuations in the on-site energies, dephasing the system. We anticipate similar behaviors in other quantum systems under continuous measurement and feedback control, making our results relevant for implementations in quantum technology and quantum control.","tags":null,"title":"Maxwell's demon across the quantum-to-classical transition","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Emery Doucet","Sebastian Deffner"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1731715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1714609980,"objectID":"2c67324d4dc53c5d99a46f4a6525b0d7","permalink":"https://qtd-hub.umd.edu/publication/2025-doucet-deffner/","publishdate":"2024-05-01T00:33:00.091248Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2025-doucet-deffner/","section":"publication","summary":"The study of measurements in quantum mechanics exposes many of the ways in which the quantum world is different. For example, one of the hallmarks of quantum mechanics is that observables may be incompatible, implying among other things that it is not always possible to find joint probability distributions which fully capture the joint statistics of multiple measurements. Instead, one must employ more general tools such as the Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability (KDQ) distribution, which may exhibit negative or non-real values heralding non-classicality. In this Letter, we consider the KDQ distributions describing arbitrary collections of measurements on disjoint components of some generic multipartite system. We show that the system dynamics ensures that these distributions are classical if and only if the Hamiltonian supports Quantum Darwinism.

Often, the charges are assumed to commute with each other (e.g., energy and particle number). Yet quantum charges can fail to commute. Noncommutation invites generalizations, which we posit and justify, of the three formulas. The noncommutation of charges, we find, breaks the equivalence of the formulas. Furthermore, different formulas quantify different physical effects of the noncommutation of charges on entropy production.

In our study, we utilize D-Wave hybrid solvers that implement classical heuristics with potential assistance from a quantum processing unit. This hybrid methodology performs comparably to existing classical solvers. However, due to the proprietary nature of the software, the precise contribution of quantum computation remains unclear. Our analysis focuses on a practical, business-oriented scenario: scheduling AGVs within a factory constrained by limited space, simulating a realistic production setting. Our approach maps a realistic AGVs problem onto one reminiscent of railway scheduling and demonstrates that the AGVs problem is better suited to quantum computing than its railway counterpart, the latter being denser in terms of the average number of constraints per variable. The main idea here is to highlight the potential usefulness of a hybrid approach for handling AGVs scheduling problems of practical sizes.

We apply the bounds to show that there exist entangled thermal states such that the parameter can be estimated with an error that decreases faster than 1/√𝑛, beating the standard quantum limit. This result governs Hamiltonians where an unknown scalar parameter (e.g., a component of a magnetic field) is coupled locally and identically to 𝑛 qubit sensors. In the high-temperature regime, our bounds allow for pinpointing the optimal estimation error, up to a constant prefactor. Our bounds generalize to joint estimations of multiple parameters.

Although entanglement between a single impurity probe and its environment produces nontrivial many-body effects, criticality cannot be leveraged for sensing. Here we introduce instead the two-impurity Kondo (2IK) model as a novel paradigm for critical quantum metrology, and examine the multiparameter estimation scenario at finite temperature. We explore the full metrological phase diagram numerically and obtain exact analytic results near criticality. Enhanced sensitivity to the inter-impurity coupling driving a second-order phase transition is evidenced by diverging quantum Fisher information (QFI) and quantum signal-to-noise ratio (QSNR). However, with uncertainty in both coupling strength and temperature, the multiparameter QFI matrix becomes singular -- even though the parameters to be estimated are independent -- resulting in vanishing QSNRs. We demonstrate that by applying a known control field, the singularity can be removed and measurement sensitivity restored.

However, the Wigner function is ill-suited for much modern quantum-information research, which is focused on finite-dimensional systems and general observables. Instead, recent years have seen the Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) distribution come to the forefront as a powerful quasi-probability distribution for analysing quantum mechanics. The KD distribution allows tools from statistics and probability theory to be applied to problems in quantum-information processing. A notable difference to the Wigner function is that the KD distribution can represent a quantum state in terms of arbitrary observables. This paper reviews the KD distribution, in three parts. First, we present definitions and basic properties of the KD distribution and its generalisations. Second, we summarise the KD distribution's extensive usage in the study or development of measurement disturbance; quantum metrology; weak values; direct measurements of quantum states; quantum thermodynamics; quantum scrambling and out-of-time-ordered correlators; and the foundations of quantum mechanics, including Leggett-Garg inequalities, the consistent-histories interpretation, and contextuality. We emphasise connections between operational quantum advantages and negative or non-real KD quasi-probabilities. Third, we delve into the KD distribution's mathematical structure. We summarise the current knowledge regarding the geometry of KD-positive states (the states for which the KD distribution is a classical probability distribution), describe how to witness and quantify KD non-positivity, and outline relationships between KD non-positivity and observables' incompatibility.","tags":null,"title":"Properties and applications of the Kirkwood-Dirac distribution","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kanu Sinha","Peter W.

This trend persists as quantum theory extends into other fields, including thermodynamics. One such assumption in thermodynamics is that conserved quantities, known as charges, commute. Lifting this assumption has led to a new subfield, noncommuting charges, at the intersection of quantum information and quantum thermodynamics. The work presented in this thesis identifies various effects of noncommuting charges and extends the topic to many-body physics and experiments. Initially, the field’s findings were conveyed in abstract information-theoretic terms. To transition these findings to experimental practice and tie them to many-body physics, constructing relevant Hamiltonians is essential. We introduce a method for constructing Hamiltonians that globally conserve noncommuting quantities while facilitating their local transport. Having demonstrated the testability of noncommuting-charge physics, we aim to delineate its effects. To do so, we construct analogous models that differ in whether their charges commute. We find that noncommuting models exhibit higher entanglement entropies. Since entanglement accompanies thermalization, our result challenges previous assertions that charges’ noncommutation hinders thermalization. Motivated by understanding noncommuting charges’ effects on entanglement, we introduce them into monitored quantum circuits. Monitored quantum circuits typically transition from a highly entangled volume-law phase to a less entangled area-law phase as one increases the rate of measurements. This holds for monitored quantum circuits with no charges and commuting ones. We find that by introducing noncommuting charges into monitored quantum circuits, the area-law phase becomes replaced with a critical phase. Since critical phases are characterized by long-range entanglement, this result reinforces entanglement enhancement by noncommuting charges. Finally, we revisit the puzzle of whether noncommuting charges promote or hinder thermalization. Most quantum many-body systems thermalize; some don’t. In those that don’t, what effect do noncommuting charges have? One type of system that does not thermalize is a system whose Hamiltonian has so-called dynamical symmetries (or spectrum-generating algebras). We find that noncommuting charges promote thermalization by reducing the dynamical symmetries in a system.","tags":null,"title":"Effects of noncommuting charges in quantum information and thermodynamics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Paul Duruisseau","Akram Touil","Sebastian Deffner"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1700611200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1694046780,"objectID":"1bb95738f8cc4ba08ac9825d7a080a33","permalink":"https://qtd-hub.umd.edu/publication/2023-duruisseau-touil-deffner/","publishdate":"2023-11-22T00:33:00.091248Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2023-duruisseau-touil-deffner/","section":"publication","summary":"Quantum Darwinism explains the emergence of classical objectivity within a quantum universe.

To this end, we categorize all models with 2-body interactions, and we show that only those with separable interaction of system and environment can support a pointer basis. We further show that ''perfect'' quantum Darwinism can only emerge if there are no intra-environmental interactions. Our analysis is complemented by the solution of the ensuing dynamics.

We start by in- troducing the concept of action quantum speed limits (QSLs). Unlike conventional geometric methods, these QSLs intricately depend on the instantaneous speed, offering bounds on the min- imal time needed to connect states. The instantaneous speed along fixed trajectories is shown to be an important and optimisable degree of freedom, as exemplified through the thermalising qubit case. Beyond discussing the feasibility of geometric QSLs, we also critically examine their interpretation in terms of different metric choices. It is revealed that these open-system QSL times provide indications of optimality concerning geodesic paths, rather than being strict minimal time indicators. Distinguishability, based on distance metrics employed in deriving QSLs (in particular the Fisher information), is also the key concept in the field of metrology. We consider the use of open system dynamics as a model to explore parameter estimation. We investigate how the presence of correlation between measurement results affects the Fisher information. These correlations are introduced through a sequential measurement scheme, where the same probe is measured multiple times in succession without allowing for equilibration. We prove that, for there to be any advantage in precision as a result of these correlations, there must be information encoded into the system-environment interaction term related to the parameter that we are trying to estimate. To emphasise this, we consider the specific case of temperature estimation where the thermalisation rate of the probe contains additional information about the temperature. The sequential scheme can be viewed as a form of collisional quantum thermometry, which further allows additional freedoms in the protocol, e.g. by introducing stochasticity in the waiting time between collisions. We establish that incorporating randomness in this manner leads to a significant expansion of the parameter range for achieving advantages over typical equilibrium approaches to thermometry. Intriguingly, we demonstrate that in certain settings optimal measurements can be performed locally, highlighting the limited role of genuine quantum correlations in this advantage. Finally, we delve into the statistics of the work done on a quantum system via a two-point measurement scheme. The Shannon entropy of the work distribution is shown to possess a general upper bound tied to initial diagonal entropy and a distinct quantum term associated with the relative entropy of coherence. This approach is shown to capture signatures of underlying physics across diverse scenarios. In particular, through an in-depth exploration of the Aubry-André-Harper model, we illustrate how the entropy of the work distribution provides a useful tool for characterising the localisation transition. We further explore the use of the entropy of the work distribution as a tool for identifying the mobility edge in a generalised Aubry-André-Harper model. Collectively, these results provide a toolbox to assess the optimality, either in terms of the dynamical paths taken, utility for metrological tasks, or ability to spotlight relevant physical properties of the model, for the dynamics of complex quantum systems.

Quantum fluctuation relations have emerged as a powerful guide to understanding nonequilibrium quantum thermodynamic processes, but they are challenging to probe experimentally due to requirements of the measurement protocols and limited access to the environment. In this talk I will show how we can use spins associated with the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond as a novel toolbox for quantum thermodynamics, thanks to the good control and coherence time, as well as our ability to tailor the interaction with a dissipative environment. As an example, I will show how we can employ repeated optical interactions to engineer a tunable dissipative channel which embodies an autonomous feedback process (Maxwell’s demon).

The latter has been the limiting factor for the available flux of atom lasers due to the large loss of atoms and the long evaporation times. Motivated by proposed fundamental tests of physics which require ultra-bright atom lasers, we developed a new approach to cooling atoms towards quantum degeneracy as an alternative to evaporative cooling. Our method relies on a self-acting one-way wall for atoms that operates away from thermal equilibrium. It uses the entropy of the photon, not its momentum, and realizes informational cooling at maximum efficiency. The method was demonstrated experimentally, and new improvements will utilize high-angular momentum states to achieve very large phase-space compression. Beyond cooling of atoms, a similar method is being used to efficiently separate isotopes for medicine at the non-profit Pointsman Foundation, www.pointsman.org.

I will introduce the most important foundational ideas in both QM and thermo, discuss how they might be brought together, and speculate on connections to cosmology and other fields. 03:00 PM — 03:15 PM Coffee Break 03:15 PM — 04:00 PM Lightning Talks 04:00 PM — 06:00 PM Poster Session 06:00 PM End of Symposium Directions to the Symposium The symposium will be held in Room 1103 of the Biosciences Research Building (BRB) at the University of Maryland, College Park.

We focus on the non-Gaussianity of the distribution, which we characterize through two quantitative metrics: skewness and negentropy. In particular, we focus on the quantum Ising model and show that a finite duration of the ramp enhances the non-Gaussianity of the distribution for a finite size system. By examining the characteristics of the full distribution, we observe that there is a clear intermediate regime between the sudden quench and adiabatic limits, where the distribution becomes increasingly skewed.","tags":["Nonequilibrium \u0026 irreversible thermodynamics","Nonequilibrium statistical mechanics","Quantum phase transitions","Quantum statistical mechanics","Quantum thermodynamics"],"title":"Non-Gaussian work statistics at finite-time driving","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Emily E.

Yet, they are also utterly inaccessible to experimentation, and even just indirect observation poses significant technical challenges. The phenomenological approach of thermodynamics is uniquely suited to explore at least some of the physical properties of such scenarios, and this has motivated the study of so-called holographic engines. We show that the efficiency of an endoreversible Brayton cycle is given by the Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency if the engine is fueled by a 2-dimensional ideal gas; and that the efficiency is higher, if the working medium is a (2+1)-dimensional BTZ black hole. These findings may be relevant not only in the quest to unlock the mysteries of black holes, but also for potential technological applications of graphene.","tags":[],"title":"Boosting thermodynamic performance by bending space-time","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shayan Majidy","Aleksander Lasek","David A.

The Page curve quantifies the bipartite entanglement of a many-body system in a random pure state. This entanglement is known to decrease if one constrains extensive observables that commute with each other (Abelian “charges”). Non-Abelian charges, which fail to commute with each other, are of current interest in quantum thermodynamics. For example, noncommuting charges were shown to reduce entropy-production rates and may enhance finite-size deviations from eigenstate thermalization. Bridging quantum thermodynamics to many-body physics, we quantify the effects of charges' noncommutation—of a symmetry's non-Abelian nature—on Page curves. First, we construct two models that are closely analogous but differ in whether their charges commute. We show analytically and numerically that the noncommuting-charge case has more entanglement. Hence charges' noncommutation can promote entanglement.","tags":["Entanglement entropy","Nonequilibrium statistical mechanics","Quantum entanglement","Quantum information theory","Quantum statistical mechanics","Quantum thermodynamics","Thermodynamics"],"title":"Non-Abelian symmetry can increase entanglement entropy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ainur Kazhybekova","Steve Campbell","Anthony Kiely"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1669334400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1670113980,"objectID":"cc97c482c9181f5a156eda80be999fd4","permalink":"https://qtd-hub.umd.edu/publication/2022-kazhybekova-campbell-kiely/","publishdate":"2022-11-25T00:33:00.091248Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022-kazhybekova-campbell-kiely/","section":"publication","summary":"We present a general protocol to control closed quantum systems that is based on minimising the adiabatic action.

We show how this diffusion constant appears in the steady-state photon emission rate of two dipoles induced by blackbody radiation. We consider in addition the Einstein–Hopf drag force on a small polarizable particle moving in a blackbody field, and derive its relativistic form from the Lorentz transformation of forces. We obtain an expression for the rate of change of the field energy density associated with changes in the particles' kinetic energies and relate it to the Kompaneets equation for the case of Compton scattering by thermalized electrons.","tags":null,"title":"Dipoles in blackbody radiation: momentum fluctuations, decoherence, and drag force","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Congratulations to our winners!
