For example, quantum particles correlate strongly through entanglement, which gives one particle a surprisingly large amount of information about others. Scientists are leveraging such quantum phenomena in technologies such as quantum computers. We combine mathematical and conceptual tools from quantum physics, information processing, and thermodynamics to understand how everyday phenomena—our classical world and the flow of time—emerge from microscopic quantum physics.\nWe address thermodynamic emergence from three angles: (1) How quickly does entanglement dissipate?

Virtual attendance is possible.\nSchedule Time Event 9:00 AM — 9:45 AM Cofee and Breakfast 9:45 AM — 10:00 AM Welcome \u0026amp; Overview of Hub 10:00 AM — 10:45 AM Paola Cappellaro, MIT An Experimental Toolbox for Quantum Thermodynamics Elucidating the laws of thermodynamics at their most fundamental level requires clarifying the thermodynamic properties of quantum systems, and especially the contributions of coherence and correlations in the concept of work and heat transfer. Quantum fluctuation relations have emerged as a powerful guide to understanding nonequilibrium quantum thermodynamic processes, but they are challenging to probe experimentally due to requirements of the measurement protocols and limited access to the environment. In this talk I will show how we can use spins associated with the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond as a novel toolbox for quantum thermodynamics, thanks to the good control and coherence time, as well as our ability to tailor the interaction with a dissipative environment. As an example, I will show how we can employ repeated optical interactions to engineer a tunable dissipative channel which embodies an autonomous feedback process (Maxwell’s demon). In turns, this allows to measure generalized energy fluctuations relations in a qutrit system. 10:45 AM — 11:00 AM Coffee Break 11:00 AM — 11:45 AM Dvira Segal, University of Toronto The Quantum Absorption Refrigerator as a Case Study in Quantum Thermodynamics Rethinking the operation principles of thermal machines in the nanoscale and quantum domain, we focus on a continuous machine operating in steady state, the quantum absorption refrigerator, and examine three key questions: (i) What is the impact of coherences within the working fluid on the performance of the quantum machine? (ii) How does the strong system-bath interaction affect the device\u0026#39;s operation? (iii) What can we learn about the machine from current noise? To examine these topics, I will discuss open quantum system techniques, which we utilize and develop. I will then describe some results, focusing on principles. Finally, I will offer my perspective on the impact of research in theoretical quantum thermodynamics on related disciplines. 11:45 AM — 01:15 PM Group photo followed by lunch 01:15 PM — 02:00 PM Mark Raizen, UT Austin Controlling and Cooling of Atoms using Photon Entropy Production of quantum degenerate atomic gases relies on laser cooling and evaporative cooling. The latter has been the limiting factor for the available flux of atom lasers due to the large loss of atoms and the long evaporation times. Motivated by proposed fundamental tests of physics which require ultra-bright atom lasers, we developed a new approach to cooling atoms towards quantum degeneracy as an alternative to evaporative cooling. Our method relies on a self-acting one-way wall for atoms that operates away from thermal equilibrium. It uses the entropy of the photon, not its momentum, and realizes informational cooling at maximum efficiency. The method was demonstrated experimentally, and new improvements will utilize high-angular momentum states to achieve very large phase-space compression. Beyond cooling of atoms, a similar method is being used to efficiently separate isotopes for medicine at the non-profit Pointsman Foundation, www.pointsman.org. This work illustrates the utility of controlling and sorting atoms to benefit humanity. 02:00 PM — 02:15 PM Coffee Break 02:15 PM — 03:00 PM Sean Carroll, JHU Philosophical Issues in Quantum Thermodynamics Quantum mechanics and thermodynamics, individually, are two areas of physics where foundational issues loom large. It stands to reason that their overlap would raise particularly pressing questions, but that specific territory is largely unexplored. I will introduce the most important foundational ideas in both QM and thermo, discuss how they might be brought together, and speculate on connections to cosmology and other fields. 03:00 PM — 03:15 PM Coffee Break 03:15 PM — 04:00 PM Lightning Talks 04:00 PM — 06:00 PM Poster Session 06:00 PM End of Symposium ","date":1678798800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1678798800,"objectID":"cf3081e376e4a5b4512f961dac9111a9","permalink":"https://qtd-hub.umd.edu/event/symposium-2023/","publishdate":"2022-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/event/symposium-2023/","section":"event","summary":"Our first symposium will take place on Tuesday, March 14th (Pi Day!), 2023!","tags":[],"title":"Maryland Quantum-Thermodynamics Symposium 2023","type":"event"},{"authors":["Krissia Zawadzki","Anthony Kiely","Gabriel T.

Yet, they are also utterly inaccessible to experimentation, and even just indirect observation poses significant technical challenges. The phenomenological approach of thermodynamics is uniquely suited to explore at least some of the physical properties of such scenarios, and this has motivated the study of so-called holographic engines. We show that the efficiency of an endoreversible Brayton cycle is given by the Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency if the engine is fueled by a 2-dimensional ideal gas; and that the efficiency is higher, if the working medium is a (2+1)-dimensional BTZ black hole. These findings may be relevant not only in the quest to unlock the mysteries of black holes, but also for potential technological applications of graphene.","tags":[],"title":"Boosting thermodynamic performance by bending space-time","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shayan Majidy","Aleksander Lasek","David A.

The Page curve quantifies the bipartite entanglement of a many-body system in a random pure state. This entanglement is known to decrease if one constrains extensive observables that commute with each other (Abelian “charges”). Non-Abelian charges, which fail to commute with each other, are of current interest in quantum thermodynamics. For example, noncommuting charges were shown to reduce entropy-production rates and may enhance finite-size deviations from eigenstate thermalization. Bridging quantum thermodynamics to many-body physics, we quantify the effects of charges' noncommutation—of a symmetry's non-Abelian nature—on Page curves. First, we construct two models that are closely analogous but differ in whether their charges commute. We show analytically and numerically that the noncommuting-charge case has more entanglement.

A single quantum spin-1/2 impurity is coupled to an explicit, structured, fermionic thermal environment. We critically assess the thermometric capabilities of the impurity as a probe, when its coupling to the environment is of Ising or Kondo exchange type. In the Ising case, we find sensitivity equivalent to that of an idealized two-level system, with peak thermometric performance obtained at a temperature that scales linearly in the applied control field, independent of the coupling strength and environment spectral features. By contrast, a richer thermometric response can be realized for Kondo impurities, since strong probe-environment entanglement can then develop. At low temperatures, we uncover a regime with a universal thermometric response that is independent of microscopic details, controlled only by the low-energy spectral features of the environment. The many-body entanglement that develops in this regime means that low-temperature thermometry with a weakly applied control field is inherently less sensitive, while optimal sensitivity is recovered by suppressing the entanglement with stronger fields.","tags":null,"title":"Thermometry of Quantum Environments with Impurity Probes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maxwell Aifer","Nathan Myers","Sebastian Deffner"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1669852800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1670113980,"objectID":"8090255058974ff4dec75305087f088a","permalink":"https://qtd-hub.umd.edu/publication/2022-aifer-myers-deffner/","publishdate":"2022-12-04T00:33:00.091248Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022-aifer-myers-deffner/","section":"publication","summary":"Among the emerging technologies with prophesied quantum advantage, quantum communications has already led to fascinating demonstrations -- including quantum teleportation to and from satellites.
