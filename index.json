Thermodynamics originally described classical systems—everyday objects formed from many particles. The theory has recently extended to the quantum domain of single electrons and few atoms, which behave in ways impossible for everyday objects. For example, quantum particles correlate strongly through entanglement, which gives one particle a surprisingly large amount of information about others. Scientists are leveraging such quantum phenomena in technologies such as quantum computers. We combine mathematical and conceptual tools from quantum physics, information processing, and thermodynamics to understand how everyday phenomena—our classical world and the flow of time—emerge from microscopic quantum physics.\nWe address thermodynamic emergence from three angles: (1) How quickly does entanglement dissipate? (2) How similar is entanglement’s dissipation to time’s arrow? (3) To what extent can quantum phenomena hinder time’s arrow? We are answering these questions via mathematical derivations, computer simulations, and experimental design. Pursuing this research unifies our team into a Maryland-centered hub—a capital for North American quantum thermodynamics—providing focus and galvanizing the growth and international impact achieved by counterparts abroad. We are working to establish Maryland as a quantum-thermodynamics leader through an international conference, symposia, seminars, and a visitors program, atop our research. We are also working to imprint quantum thermodynamics on the public consciousness through a dedicated website and blog posts, organizing a science-fiction short-story contest, and contributions to mainstream media.\nUncovering how everyday phenomena emerge from microscopic quantum dynamics, we are illuminating fundamental physics while establishing a lodestone for North American quantum thermodynamics.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"8576ec274c98b3831668a172fa632d80","permalink":"https://qtd-hub.umd.edu/about/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/about/","section":"","summary":"Quantum thermodynamics is an emerging field that offers fundamental insights into energy, information, and their relationship.

However, all optical communication necessitates the use of optical devices, and their comprehensive quantum thermodynamic description is still severely lacking. In the present analysis we prove several versions of Landauer's principle for noisy polarizers, namely absorbing linear polarizers and polarizing beamsplitters. As main results we obtain statements of the second law quantifying the minimal amount of heat that is dissipated in the creating of linearly polarized light. Our findings are illustrated with an experimentally tractable example, namely the temperature dependence of a quantum eraser.","tags":["Quantum Physics (quant-ph)","Optics (physics.optics)","FOS: Physical sciences","FOS: Physical sciences"],"title":"Thermodynamics of quantum information in noisy polarizers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kanu Sinha","Peter W Milonni"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1665705600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1670113980,"objectID":"46ca59025a24d00a50cb3f42ca7b1bcc","permalink":"https://qtd-hub.umd.edu/publication/2022-sinha-milonni/","publishdate":"2022-12-04T00:32:59.853702Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022-sinha-milonni/","section":"publication","summary":"An expression is derived for the momentum diffusion constant due to photon scattering of a small polarizable particle in blackbody radiation, and is shown to be related to the long-wavelength collisional decoherence rate for such a particle in a thermal environment. We show how this diffusion constant appears in the steady-state photon emission rate of two dipoles induced by blackbody radiation. We consider in addition the Einstein–Hopf drag force on a small polarizable particle moving in a blackbody field, and derive its relativistic form from the Lorentz transformation of forces. We obtain an expression for the rate of change of the field energy density associated with changes in the particles' kinetic energies and relate it to the Kompaneets equation for the case of Compton scattering by thermalized electrons.","tags":[],"title":"Dipoles in blackbody radiation: momentum fluctuations, decoherence, and drag force\n","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Emily E.

Yet, they are also utterly inaccessible to experimentation, and even just indirect observation poses significant technical challenges. The phenomenological approach of thermodynamics is uniquely suited to explore at least some of the physical properties of such scenarios, and this has motivated the study of so-called holographic engines. We show that the efficiency of an endoreversible Brayton cycle is given by the Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency if the engine is fueled by a 2-dimensional ideal gas; and that the efficiency is higher, if the working medium is a (2+1)-dimensional BTZ black hole. These findings may be relevant not only in the quest to unlock the mysteries of black holes, but also for potential technological applications of graphene.","tags":[],"title":"Boosting thermodynamic performance by bending space-time","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Akira Sone","Diogo O.
