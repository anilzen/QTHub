&lt;h3 id="statistical-mechanics-with-stochastic-dynamics">Statistical Mechanics with Stochastic Dynamics&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>There are a number of deep questions at the foundations of statistical mechanics, including the rigorous justification of its probability distributions, the limitations of ergodicity, the origins of the thermodynamic arrow of time, and the precise intertheoretic reduction of classical thermodynamics to quantum mechanics. In this talk, I will argue that a new approach to formulating quantum theory in terms of ‘indivisible’ stochastic dynamics may provide new resources for answering these questions, as well as for related problems, like making microphysical sense of causal influences. By employing this new indivisible formulation, I will also show how to use simple thermodynamic systems to build real-world analog models of quantum systems, like qubits.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="quantum-scarring-in-many-body-quantum-systems">Quantum scarring in many-body quantum systems&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Quantum scars, introduced within the context of single-particle billiard model in 1984, are quantum eigenstates with an enhanced probability density around an unstable periodic orbit (UPO) in a chaotic phase space. Recently, nonthermal many-body eigenstates embedded in an otherwise thermal spectrum have been identified as a many-body generalization of quantum scars. This concept, however, is not associated to a chaotic phase space, and hence the connection between the single- and many-body notions of quantum scars had remained incomplete. In this talk, I will present the first quantum many-body scars originating from UPOs of a chaotic phase space in different spin models. These states verify the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, and we thus refer to them as thermal quantum many-body scars. While they do not preclude thermalization, their spectral structure featuring approximately equispaced towers of states yields an anomalous oscillatory dynamics preceding thermalization for wavepackets initialized on a UPO. I will highlight a particular spin-1 chain which hosts both types of scars, thermal and nonthermal where the latter is associated with stable periodic orbits. Time permitting, I will also provide evidence for the ubiquity of scarred quantum eigenstates in a generic spin-1/2 chain, and how scarring makes the system more likely to be found on an orbit it was initialized on, retaining a memory of its past.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The precise control of quantized degrees of freedom available in trapped ion quantum computers/simulators have already been leveraged to perform seminal projects of experimental quantum thermodynamics (QTD). In this talk I will describe the standard trapped ion toolkit for quantum simulation - the contemporary ways in which both the ion&amp;rsquo;s valence electronic state and the ions harmonic motion (i.e. phonons) are controlled in the lab. Additionally, I will present a short description of the early QTD experiments which used this toolkit and preview the means of expanding the toolkit, presently being pursued in my lab and others. Time allowing, I will briefly compare trapped ion simulators to other simulation platforms and/or comment on trapped ion quantum computers as tools for experimental QTD.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="towards-quantum-field-thermodynamics-observational-entropy-and-operational-definitions-of-work-and-heat">Towards Quantum Field Thermodynamics: Observational Entropy and Operational Definitions of Work and Heat&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We will review the notions of internal energy and work distributions in quantum field theory (QFT), highlighting the limitations of extending standard thermodynamic definitions—many of them originally developed for finite-dimensional quantum systems—to the infinite-dimensional, local setting of QFT. Following this review, we will argue for a reformulation of thermodynamic concepts such as work, heat, and entropy within the algebraic framework of von Neumann algebras, which is the language that naturally encodes the operational and localization structure of QFT. This shift is essential for constructing a physically meaningful extension of quantum thermodynamics beyond finite systems, particularly in addressing the inadequacy of the von Neumann entropy to capture thermodynamic behavior in scenarios involving coarse-grained observations or limited resolution. Within this framework, we introduce a generalization of observational entropy for systems with a richer set of controllable degrees of freedom.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In the first part of this talk, I will discuss the distillation of coherent states from multiple coherent thermal states under general phase-insensitive operations&amp;ndash;protocols that combine several copies of noisy coherent states to obtain a single mode in a less noisy state, i.e., at a lower temperature. I will present the optimal protocol that yields the closest output to the desired coherent state and show that the error is governed by the so-called RLD Fisher information metric, thereby providing an operational interpretation of this quantity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the second part, I will discuss an ongoing project on energy-conserving quantum circuits, i.e., circuits that conserve the intrinsic Hamiltonian of qubits. I will explain how general energy-conserving unitary transformations can be implemented using energy-conserving interactions, such as the XY interaction, provided that one can employ a single ancillary qubit that acts as a catalyst.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The repeated system-bath interaction model, also known as the quantum collision model, remains a versatile framework for studying quantum heat transport phenomena. This approach allows us to identify the fundamental symmetries that govern these behaviors. I will illustrate this by discussing our recent work, in which we thoroughly investigated thermal rectification (asymmetric heat conduction) in scenarios similar to single atomic junctions, quantum thermal machines, quantum thermalization, and coherence generation in the steady state through composite interactions.&lt;/p>

&lt;div class="collapse" id="Cappellaro">
Elucidating the laws of thermodynamics at their most fundamental level requires clarifying the thermodynamic properties of quantum systems, and especially the contributions of coherence and correlations in the concept of work and heat transfer. Quantum fluctuation relations have emerged as a powerful guide to understanding nonequilibrium quantum thermodynamic processes, but they are challenging to probe experimentally due to requirements of the measurement protocols and limited access to the environment. In this talk I will show how we can use spins associated with the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond as a novel toolbox for quantum thermodynamics, thanks to the good control and coherence time, as well as our ability to tailor the interaction with a dissipative environment. As an example, I will show how we can employ repeated optical interactions to engineer a tunable dissipative channel which embodies an autonomous feedback process (Maxwell’s demon). In turns, this allows to measure generalized energy fluctuations relations in a qutrit system.

&lt;div class="collapse" id="Segal">
Rethinking the operation principles of thermal machines in the nanoscale and quantum domain, we focus on a continuous machine operating in steady state, the quantum absorption refrigerator, and examine three key questions: (i) What is the impact of coherences within the working fluid on the performance of the quantum machine? (ii) How does the strong system-bath interaction affect the device's operation? (iii) What can we learn about the machine from current noise? To examine these topics, I will discuss open quantum system techniques, which we utilize and develop. I will then describe some results, focusing on principles. Finally, I will offer my perspective on the impact of research in theoretical quantum thermodynamics on related disciplines.

&lt;div class="collapse" id="Raizen">
Production of quantum degenerate atomic gases relies on laser cooling and evaporative cooling. The latter has been the limiting factor for the available flux of atom lasers due to the large loss of atoms and the long evaporation times. Motivated by proposed fundamental tests of physics which require ultra-bright atom lasers, we developed a new approach to cooling atoms towards quantum degeneracy as an alternative to evaporative cooling. Our method relies on a self-acting one-way wall for atoms that operates away from thermal equilibrium. It uses the entropy of the photon, not its momentum, and realizes informational cooling at maximum efficiency. The method was demonstrated experimentally, and new improvements will utilize high-angular momentum states to achieve very large phase-space compression. Beyond cooling of atoms, a similar method is being used to efficiently separate isotopes for medicine at the non-profit Pointsman Foundation, www.pointsman.org. This work illustrates the utility of controlling and sorting atoms to benefit humanity.
