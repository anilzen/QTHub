### Dissipation as a Resource: Coherence Recovery and Chaos Control

Dissipation is commonly regarded as an obstacle to quantum control, as it induces decoherence and irreversibility. In this talk, we show that dissipation can instead be exploited as a resource to engineer and regulate complex dynamics in interacting quantum systems. Using an experimentally realizable two-species Bose-Josephson junction, we demonstrate that dissipation enables distinct dynamical regimes, including synchronized phase-locked oscillations, transient chaos, and steady-state chaos. The emergence of each behavior is determined by experimentally tunable parameters. Remarkably, dissipation regulates the duration of chaotic behavior and information scrambling, and can restore coherence at long times.
