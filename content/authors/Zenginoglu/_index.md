I regard science administration as the highest form of public service and enjoy bringing researchers together in thematically focused but geographically distributed networks. My administrative work started in 2014 with an NSF-funded research network on kinetic theory called [Ki-Net](https://www.ki-net.umd.edu/). I took on various roles such as Coordinator, Community Manager, IT Manager, and Acting Business Director. Currently, I serve the UMD [University Senate](https://www.senate.umd.edu/), the APS [Data Science Education Community of Practice](https://dsecop.org), the [Burgers Program in Fluid Dynamics](https://ipst.umd.edu/research/burgers), the research program for undergraduates [TREND](https://ireap.umd.edu/trend), and the [Maryland Quantum-Thermodynamics Hub](https://qtd-hub.umd.edu).
