abstract: "Simon's algorithm was one of the first problems to demonstrate a genuine quantum advantage. The algorithm, however, assumes access to noise-free qubits. In our work we use Simon's algorithm to benchmark the error rates of devices currently available in the 'quantum cloud.' As a main result we obtain an objective comparison between the different physical platforms made available by IBM and IonQ. Our study highlights the importance of understanding the device architectures and chip topologies when transpiling quantum algorithms onto hardware. For instance, we demonstrate that two-qubit operations on spatially separated qubits on superconducting chips should be avoided."
