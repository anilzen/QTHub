abstract: "Quantum synchronization is crucial for understanding complex dynamics and holds potential applications in quantum computing and communication. Therefore, assessing the thermodynamic resources required for finite-time synchronization in continuous-variable systems is a critical challenge. In the present work, we find these resources to be extensive for large systems. We also bound the speed of quantum and classical synchronization in coupled damped oscillators with non-Hermitian anti-PT-symmetric interactions, and show that the speed of synchronization is limited by the interaction strength relative to the damping. Compared to the classical limit, we find that quantum synchronization is slowed by the non-commutativity of the Hermitian and anti-Hermitian terms. Our general results could be tested experimentally and we suggest an implementation in photonic systems."
