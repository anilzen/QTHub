abstract: "Controlled quantum machines have matured significantly. A natural next step is to grant them autonomy, freeing them from timed external control. For example, autonomy could unfetter quantum computers from classical control wires that heat and decohere them; and an autonomous quantum refrigerator recently reset superconducting qubits to near their ground states, as is necessary before a computation. What conditions are necessary for realizing useful autonomous quantum machines? Inspired by recent quantum thermodynamics and chemistry, we posit conditions analogous to DiVincenzo's criteria for quantum computing. Our criteria are intended to foment and guide the development of useful autonomous quantum machines."
