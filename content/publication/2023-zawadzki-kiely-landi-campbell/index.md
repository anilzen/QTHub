abstract: "We study properties of the work distribution of a many-body system driven through a quantum phase transition in finite time. We focus on the non-Gaussianity of the distribution, which we characterize through two quantitative metrics: skewness and negentropy. In particular, we focus on the quantum Ising model and show that a finite duration of the ramp enhances the non-Gaussianity of the distribution for a finite size system. By examining the characteristics of the full distribution, we observe that there is a clear intermediate regime between the sudden quench and adiabatic limits, where the distribution becomes increasingly skewed."
