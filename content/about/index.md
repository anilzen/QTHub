Quantum thermodynamics is an emerging field that offers fundamental
insights into energy, information, and their relationship. Thermodynamics
originally described classical systems—everyday objects formed from
many particles. The theory has recently extended to the quantum domain
of single electrons and few atoms, which behave in ways impossible for
everyday objects. For example, quantum particles correlate strongly
through entanglement, which gives one particle a surprisingly large amount
of information about others. Scientists are leveraging such quantum
phenomena in technologies such as quantum computers. We combine
mathematical and conceptual tools from quantum physics, information
processing, and thermodynamics to understand how everyday phenomena
—our classical world and the flow of time—emerge from microscopic
quantum physics.

From 2022 to 2025, the Maryland Quantum-Thermodynamics Hub
addressed thermodynamic emergence from three angles: (1) How quickly
does entanglement dissipate? (2) How similar is entanglement’s dissipation
to time’s arrow? (3) To what extent can quantum phenomena hinder time’s
arrow? In each branch of research, we found a tension, or an apparent
conflict. Such conflicts fuel physics. So, from 2025 to 2028, we are
resolving those tensions. Also, we are addressing another angle on
thermodynamic emergence: (4) How does quantum gravity give rise to
smooth space-time? We leverage abstract theory, numerical simulations,
and experimental collaborations.

Pursuing this research unifies our team into a Maryland-based hub, a
center for North American quantum thermodynamics. We partner with
international institutions to form a global network. Our events include
annual gatherings and seminars. Also, we engage the general public in the
adventure of quantum thermodynamics through a quantum-steampunk
creative-writing course, a quantum-steampunk creative-writing contest,
contributions to mainstream media, public lectures, and blog posts.
Uncovering how everyday phenomena emerge from microscopic quantum
dynamics, we are illuminating fundamental physics while establishing a
lodestone for North American quantum thermodynamics.
